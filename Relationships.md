- **Indifference** is absence of any of the 3 types of love; no connection or relationship.
- **Friendship** is intimacy without passion or commitment. This includes friendships and sometimes acquaintances.
- **Infatuatuation** is passion without intimacy or commitment. This is considered "puppy love" or relationships that have not become serious yet. Romantic relationships often start out as infatuated love and become romantic love as intimacy develops over time. Without developing intimacy or commitment, infatuated love may disappear suddenly.
- **Passionless love** is characterized by commitment without intimacy or passion; an "empty" love. A stronger love may deteriorate into empty love. In an arranged marriage, the relationship may begin empty and develop into something more, indicating "empty love need not be the terminal state of a long-term relationship -- but the beginning, rather than the end".
- **Romantic love** is passionate and intimate but has no commitment. This could be considered a romantic affair or could be a one-night stand.
- **Companionate love** is an intimate, non-passionate type of love that is stronger than friendship because of the element of long-term commitment. "This type of love is observed in long-term marriages where passion is no longer present" but where a deep affection and commitment remain. The love ideally shared between family members is a form of companionate love, as is the love between close friends who have a platonic but strong friendship.
- **Fatuous love** can be exemplified by a whirlwind courtship and marriage -- it has points of passion and commitment but no intimacy. An example of this is "love at first sight".
- **Consummate love** is the all-encompassing form of love in this model, representing an idealized relationship which people strive towards. Of the 7 varieties, consummate love is theorized to be that love associated with the "perfect match". According to Sternberg, these couples will continue to have passion and longing 15 years or more into the relationship; they cannot imagine themselves happier over the long-term with anyone else, they overcome their difficulties together, and delight in their relationship with each other. Maintaining a consummate love may be even harder than achieving it; if passion is lost over time, it may change into companionate love.

Sternberg's triangular theory of love provides a strong foundation for his later theory of love, entitled Love as a Story.

In this theory, he explains that the large numbers of unique and different love stories convey different ways of how love is understood. He believes, over time, this exposure helps a person determine what love is or what it should be to them. These two theories create Sternberg's duplex theory of love.

"Personal relationships that have the greatest longevity and satisfaction are those in which partners are constantly working on sustaining intimacy and reinforcing commitment to each other."
