# Dwarf Slayer

#### Dwarf
- **Blind**: You are naturally blind and are always subject to the Blind condition. 
- **Brave**: You aren't subject to visual stimuli, so you have advantage on saving throws against being frightened or charmed, and against illusions, and other mine-effects.
- **Superior Unarmed Strength**: Your increased muscle density means your unarmed strikes are extra powerful for a creature you're size. Your unarmed strikes deal 1d6+Str mod, and Strength contests always tie-break in your favor.
- **Charging Rush**: Immediately after you use the Dash action on your turn and move at least 20 feet, you can make a melee attack as a bonus action.
- **Hammering Fists**: Immediately after you hit a creature with a melee attack, you can use a bonus action to attempt to grapple or shove that target.



## Dwarf Slayer
**Requires**: dwarf or permanent blindness. 
**Hit Dice:** 1d12 per barbarian level  
**Hit Points at 1st Level:** 12 + Con mod
**Hit Points at Higher Levels:** 1d12 (or 7) + your Constitution modifier per barbarian level after 1st

##### Proficiencies
**Armor:** shields  
**Weapons:** Simple, martial  
**Tools:** None

**Skills:** Choose two from Animal Handling, Athletics, Intimidation, Nature, Perception, and Survival

##### Equipment
You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:
- (a) a war-rope (flail+whip) or (b) any martial melee weapon
- (a) two tonfa (clubs) or (b) any simple weapon
- An explorer's pack and 4 daggers

### Rage
In battle, you fight with primal ferocity. On your turn, you can enter a rage as a bonus action.
While raging, you gain the following benefits if you aren't wearing heavy armor:
- You have advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws.
- When you make a melee attack using Strength, you gain a bonus to damage equal to proficiency
- You have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.

If you are able to cast spells, you can't cast them or concentrate on them while raging.
It ends early if you are knocked unconscious or if your turn ends and you haven't attacked a hostile creature since your last turn or taken damage since then. You can also end your rage on your turn as a bonus action. When you finish a rage, you gain a level of exhaustion.
You can take a number of times equal to proficiency bonus per long rest.

### Unarmored Defense
While wearing no armor, your AC equals 10 +Dex mod +Con mod. You can use a shield and still gain this benefit.

### Dungeon Delver
At 2nd level, you gain an uncanny sense for hidden traps and secret doors, you gain the following benefits:
- +Adv on Perception and Investigation checks made to detect the presence of secret doors.
- +Adv on saves made to avoid or resist traps.
- Resistance to the damage dealt by traps.
- Travelling at a fast pace doesn't impose the normal -5 penalty on your passive Perception score.

### Reckless Attack
Starting at 2nd level, you can throw aside all concern for defense to attack with fierce desperation. When you make your first attack on your turn, you can decide to attack recklessly. Doing so gives you advantage on melee weapon attack rolls using Strength during this turn, but attack rolls against you have advantage until your next turn.

### Wild Abandon
At 3rd level, you gain resistance to all damage except psychic damage when reading.
While you're raging and aren't wearing armor, other creatures have disadvantage on opportunity attack rolls against you, and you can use the Dash action as a bonus action on your turn.

### Mobile
Starting at 5th level, your speed increases by 10 feet while you aren't wearing armor; when you use the Dash action, difficult terrain doesn't cost you extra movement on that turn.
When you make a melee attack against a creature, you don't provoke opportunity attacks from that creature for the rest of the turn, whether you hit or not.

### Retaliation
Starting at 6th level, when you take damage from a creature that is within 5ft of you, you can use your reaction to make a melee attack against that creature.

### Feral Instinct
By 7th level, your instincts are so honed that you have advantage on initiative rolls.
Additionally, if you are surprised at the beginning of combat and aren't incapacitated, you can act normally on your first turn, but only if you enter your rage before doing anything else on that turn.

### Instinctive Pounce
At 7th level, as part of the bonus action you take to enter your rage, you can move up to half your speed.

### Brutal Critical
Beginning at 9th level, you can roll one additional weapon damage die when determining the extra damage for a critical hit with a melee attack.

### Relentless Rage
Starting at 11th level, your rage can keep you fighting despite grievous wounds. If you drop to 0 hit points while you're raging and don't die outright, you can make a DC 10 Con save. If you succeed, you drop to 1 hit point instead.
Each time you use this feature after the first, the DC increases by 5. When you finish a short or long rest, the DC resets to 10.
