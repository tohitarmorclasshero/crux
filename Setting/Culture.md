###### Runeknights
dwarf tradition that gets around their nonmagical nature by using forcibles to grant them powers from captive spellcasters. these spellcasters are left stupefied, easily confused, and needing special care. 
this is the dwarf version of paladin/templar/cleric

###### Political Shenanigans
The dwarfs have a saint dedicated to lying and subterfuge, have institutionalized assassination, and tacitly accept embezzlement and bribery. In any situation at least 1 person is going to be following a secret agenda and/or hiding their true factional allegiance, perpetrating a scam, doing the dirty on a rival, looking for an opportunity for blackmail, and so on so forth. Dwarfs are a deeply honorable people, and don’t you ever forget it if you wish to avoid getting involved in a duel; but in the quest to climb the social ladder they are willing to commit any number of dubious deeds.

###### Punctilious Etiquette
Dwarfs are honorable people; touchy and liable to indulge in "lawsuits" and violence if they feel their honor has been impugned and so they're always very polite and correct. This correctness includes talking to the lower castes as if they're shit, and groveling outrageously to the upper caste and never contradict or disagree with them outright even when they're talking utter rubbish, out of fear of lawsuit or death. I suggest in each scenario there should be at least 1 awkward situation where players have to talk their way out of a sticky social situation where the possibility of death and mutilation for ‘rudeness’ is an ever present threat.

###### Casual Cruelty
Tékumel is a fun place to visit, but living there would be hell. People are mutilated for being rude to arrogant stuck-up pea-brained nobles, people are born into rubbish jobs like latrine digger and expected to remain such the whole of their miserable lives, there's open racism and subtle sectarianism. At all levels of society you can encounter heartless oppression and cruelty. Make your players uncomfortable by shoving this fact in their face every so often, and if possible require them to participate.

###### Weird Magic
Tékumel is magical place; people point at stuff and it explodes, they take over each others minds like puppeteers and the dead get up and walk. There's a lot of fraudsters making magical claims they can't back up too, but once in a while you meet some magical phenomenon that will make your skin crawl and your mind reel. If the players ever start taking magic for granted remind them that it emanates from the mysterious gaps between the universes and mere mortals must be very careful with it lest they lose their very souls.

###### Obtuse Tech
Tékumel is a scientific place; the whole planet is an artificial environment, its very gravity has been modified by technology, all of the edible food are GMO crops and there are androids and robots on the loose below most cities zapping people with laser beams. Once in a while let the players come across a piece of familiar technology in this unfamiliar setting. What would downtime folks make of a mobile phone? A beeping flashing idol that lets you talk to god? What use would they make of an Eye of Retaining All Things Forever (a holographic camera)?

###### Alien Vistas and Ancient Ruins
Tékumel contains animals and plants from at least 20 different planets, has over 10 intelligent alien species; not counting the ones that have gone extinct, visit occasionally from other planes, or pretend to be semi-intelligent at best to avoid hassle. Your chances of finding a familiar terrestrial type animal or plant on Tékumel is very slim. Remind the players of this regularly with outbreaks of strange alien wildlife and flora; floating rafts of flax guarded against pests by semi-domesticated polyps, flute-trees which use sound to attract insect pollinators rather than bright flowers, pollinators which are not insects at all but gas-filled aerial mollusks.

###### Tékumel is Very Old
The gap between the fall of Éngsvan hlá Gánga and the rise of the Empire is 10,000 years, a span of time equivalent to the whole of earthly history from the first permanently settled villages in the hills of the Fertile Crescent to the modern day. The Empire of the Petal Throne is 2300 years old; this is as if the Roman Empire never fell in earthly terms. Players should come across stupendously old buildings on a regular basis with 500 year old clan-houses made of ever repaired and recycled mud brick a commonplace, a town's ‘new’ temple being a mere millennium old and an architectural curio decorated with bas reliefs of writhing feshénga and dancing girls in an unknown style and commemorating a king and kingdom long forgotten standing half-buried and used as káika-coop by the local peasants. Shelley's Ozymandias would feel right at home on Tékumel.

###### Exotic Food and Overstated Costume
The Dying Earth novels are full of descriptions of the fantastic meals and outfits that are the hallmark of its self-indulgent society, and likewise Tékumel makes great use of outlandish costume and cuisine in creating a similar atmosphere. We should do the same in our scenarios, making the irruption of a temple procession into the world of off-white kilts and loincloths in the back streets of Jakálla a feast for the eyes with plumed masks and embroidered banners, the shaven scalps of the priests painted with icons and hordes of acolytes throwing flowers across the path. No official is properly dressed without his Official Headdress, covered in symbols depicting his role in the bureaucracy (even if he is supervisor of sewers and latrine pits), and everyone must wear something communicating their clan origin and religious allegiance. Make players describe their characters everyday apparel and ornamentation.
And the food needs some attention as well -- feasts are a regular occurrence, so what do people eat? On a world where terrestrial-style vertebrates are a bit of a rarity and there are thousands of vegetables and spices from all round the galaxy all kinds of possibilities arise. A favorite starter in lands bordering the Gilraya Forest is wasp-nests; a certain species of wasp makes little nests 5-10cm across which have enough resin in their paper to stand being dunked into boiling water for 30 seconds or so. This poaches their grubs nicely and the nest can be served cut in two and the diner can remove the larvae with a wooden toothpick. Or aprai-melons stuffed with yakï beans? Aprai melons are toxic, yes, but the beans neutralize the toxins, you just have make sure you use enough of them. Cooking and Toxicology are closely related disciplines on Tékumel.

Not every scenario is going to use all of these elements, but adding a few of them will make a simple little job like throwing a gang of squatters out of a run-down building into a true Tékumel extravaganza.
