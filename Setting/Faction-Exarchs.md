# Faction-Exarchs

EXARCHES of SHADOW
Spawned from the Time of Fire & Madness, the Exarchs are said to dwell in the Lightless Depths. They undermine the world by sending their fiends to sow suffering, & by tempting mortals toward apathy & cruelty. The Exarchs themselves are kept in check by the Pillars of Eternity, but their patience is limitless & their power great.
Exarchs are only worshipped by the malicious & insane, or in lands such as Kern where the followers of the Whispering Tyrant proclaim him as One True God & Exarch. The exarchsâ€™ worshipers give them grand, improbable titles and engage in unspeakable rites.
They have some connection to the Chaos Gods & the Lords of Dust, but little is known about the Exarchs in modern times besides their names and domains: 
1. Gravicarus of Pride
2. Tyrexxus of Wrath
3. Ulasta of Envy
4. Innassi of Lust
5. Viasta of Sloth
6. Yingun of Gluttony
7. Mixxtak of Greed
