# Faction-Sleepers Below

The **Sleepers Below** is the name given by the Ilee of Apostae island to a cylindrical chamber miles long and hundreds of feet in diameter, criss-crossed by metal walkways. Possibly millions of glass-smooth eggs lie beneath the walkways. Within each floats a single creature in stasis ranging in size from fly-sized to colossal. Thousands of tiny crab-like creatures scuttle and probe over them, sometimes injecting unknown substances or surrounding them in an electrical nimbus. Human visitors might spot others of their kind within the eggs, albeit dressed in weird clothing and markings.

Some Ilee believe that the creatures within the eggs are their cousins, whom they have to protect until the mythical Day of Awakening. Others seek to actively awaken them (as the Day of Awakening will only come when the Ilee are strong enough), but are thwarted in their efforts by the tiny machines. Yet others think that the sleepers are the true power source of Apostae, and the Ilee are just a dream that will end once the sleepers awake. 

**Grandfather Stone** is the name given by the Ilee to the only construct on Apostae capable of speaking. An ancient, brilliant creature, Grandfather Stone is the only being on Apostae that remembers the island's true nature.

Grandfather Stone is a 10ft-tall construct consisting of a square head with multiple eyes, and several tentacles ending in delicate hands and grasping claws that usually just lie on the floor. His chamber is small and mostly filled with his body, and he merges seamlessly with the walls at his shoulders.

Grandfather Stone remembers Apostae's origin, and its intended mission, but over the years, his hardware has degraded, and his knowledge has become muddled as a result. He answers questions in a cryptic manner, with strange languages and confusing metaphors, which only scholars can understand, and sometimes he might just tear apart visitors for no apparent reason. Only the bravest Ilee dare to petition him.

Grandfather Stone remembers that the original purpose of the Sleepers Below was related to zoology, but he cannot recall whether its goal was to take samples or introduce fully formed creatures to habitable planets.

Similarly, he knows that Apostae originated so far from the solar system that it must have been a generation ship, but he's forgotten whether the Ilee are the inbred descendants of the crew, creatures engineered to be pilots, or the offspring of a race originally harvested by the crew that ended up turning against them and erasing their traces.
