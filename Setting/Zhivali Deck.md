## The Fools
8 of the major arcana are called the Fools, and represent popular literary archetypes.

#### 1. Player
The character known as “the Player” rises up through society through some sort of Art. They come from humble beginnings, but convinced by the praise of others, loses sight of those beginnings.

#### 2. Dowager
The Dowager is advanced in age, but refuses to acknowledge the inevitable grasp of Solace. They act as if they're still young until the cruel truth of the world comes knocking on her door, and finding them unprepared, they face death, losing the sleep of Solace forever.

#### 3. Right Hand / 2nd Heart
The archetypal neglectful spouse. Often male, although portrayed as female on rare occasions (and equally rare success). Their undoing is underestimating their partner's desires for independence and happiness.

#### 4. Left Hand / 1st Heart
The 1st Heart is demanding, selfish, and proud; the things that allowed them to reach the pinnacle of society. Unfortunately, these same qualities are their undoing.

#### 5. Rake
The Rake is unattached, looking to rise in society through romantic conquests. Their undoing is their own shallowness and misunderstanding of the sacredness of love.

#### 6. Swordsman
Their Prowess unmatched, they walk the streets of Shanri unafraid, taking all challenges. This is Cyrvanto -- the Champion -- arrogant & proud of it; they refuse apologies, demanding the Sword answer all threats to Satisfaction.

#### 7. Mentat
The character of the Mentat -- the wise one -- is one of the least popular subjects in Harlequin Opera. Of all the Fools, their tragedy seems the most difficult to make compelling. Most Artists see the Mentat as a challenge, attempting to make this character into high Art. Most fail.

#### 8. Companions
Another omnipresent element of Opera is the presence of "the Companions". Two Frieds, always named Ythala (brash) and Talsho (subtle), appear in all variations, acting as a kind of Greek chorus, giving exposition to the audience with their gossip. Traditionally, the Companions have the last word, giving the moral of the Opera to the audience, although more bold artists use the Companions to comment on the moral. Dangerous; but then again, True Art always is.
