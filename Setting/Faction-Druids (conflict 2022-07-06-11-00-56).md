### Faction-Druid


**Druidism** originated thousands years ago when the unicorn Varak foretold a great sundering. In order to help humans survive she taught the First Children of the bonds between the progenitor elements as well as how to tap into that power and use it. These original druids are still known as Gatekeepers and Greenseers and continue to defend our reality from invasions from other hostile dimentions.

Seven thousand years after Varak trained the first Gatekeepers and Greenseers, the invasion that was foretold brought the Lords of Dust swarming into our reality through gates from Xoriat. The entire Gatekeeper Circle and a small cabal of Greenseers were able to repel their minions and seal away or destroy the Dustlords, saving the world from merging with that nightmarish dimension. The rest of the Greenseer Circle is despised to this day for failing their sworn duty. 

In the generations since, other druid sects have branched off or been founded whole-cloth. Though each of these traditions have varying beliefs they all share a commonality in their reverence for tradition. 

Although the Jade Hell often comes to mind when thinking of druids and druidism there are druids all across the world. Anywhere humans dwell one can find druids of every sect.

Leaving behind the ties of family and home, druids travel between communities, teaching, guiding, protecting, and fostering cooperation and communication between far-flung tribes. Often among the most powerful spellcasters, druids serve as champions of the people and valuable advisors to commanders and lords.

### Ashbound
The Ashbound are an extreme druidic order, who consider undeath to be an extension of life. They commodify life and death, using dark necromancy too create a caste of undead slave labor to create wealth for their adherents and themselves. 

### Beasts of Winter
The darkest of the sects, they believe magic to be "unnatural". They seek to cleanse humanity of the bought of symbolic thought, and consider even common agriculture to be outside the natural balance. They prefer to avoid bloodshed, but the more severe elements within the order are not above terrorism to advance their make their point.

### Gatekeepers
Dedicated to keeping this reality free of "unnatural" external influences, having battled extraplanar invasions and aberrations for centuries. The Gatekeepers are the oldest druidic tradition, directly descending from the followers of the unicorn Varak. Gatekeepers defend against aberrations, outsiders, undead and other unnatural horrors. While diminished in size, the order remains vigilant and maintains a relatively friendly relationship with the Wardens of the Wood. 

### Mask Weavers
Besides the typical healing, they primarily help craft spirit masks which allow druids to transform into beasts. The Mask Weavers also serve as historians, preserving vital oral traditions and beliefs, memories and songs of the people.

### Greenwardens
The largest and most influential of the druid sects. During the Last War, the Wardens became the de facto governing body of the Riverlands. Wardens rallied the people to defend their lands against crusaders and foreign nations with designs on their abundant lands and resources. The Wardens are respected and well-liked.

### Skywatchers
The Siyal Marrain, or Skywatchers, are a charged with keeping the Valenaran steeds, believed to be the descendants of warriors who fought to free the people from slavery, but were cursed to remain in the animal forms they had taken to carry their comrades into battle.
They serve two roles: 
1st, they are charged with preserving the bloodline of those ancestral creatures. Protect the breeding grounds, tend to injured, and help raise young. These blood guardians mingle with the herd using wild shape and speak with animals, forging the bond between beast and human from the earliest days after birth. 
2nd, they match beast and rider, working to forge the sacred  spirit-bond between them. 
Beyond this, the Siyal Marrain are warriors. Just as their ancestors fought with lightning and flame, the druids of the modern day may ride with a warband, turning the power of nature against their enemies.
House Vadalis would love nothing better than to obtain some of their steeds to create their own offshoot stock. The Siyal Marrain are a formidable barrier to that objective, believing such a thing would bring the greatest dishonor on them and the beasts, whom they consider to be their siblings.

### Sela's Path
Sela's Path is the pseudo-religious sect within House Lyrandar. The sect is not inherently a druidic sect, but there are many human druids within Sela's Path. The worship of St Arawai is a large part of their tradition, and the dragonmarked house is intimately concerned with the governance of the natural order and weather control, as they have interests in both the agricultural industry and commercial  shipping.

### Greenseer
Some in the Riverlands are born with a natural sensitivity to spacetime, called the greensight. The Greenseers harness and guide these young talents to prevent disturbances the continuum, protect them from exploitation, and instruct them how to safely harness their power without endangering the fabric of reality.  Many believe they're responsible for carving faces into weirwoods, creating heart trees. Stories describe the greenseers peering through the tree faces, influencing animals and plants, and even seeing into the past and future.
