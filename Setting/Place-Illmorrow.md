# Place-Illmorrow

The **Emerald Spire of Illmorrow** is a strange ruin in the northwest River Kingdoms. Located in a large clearing in the Echo Wood near the Crusader Road, 6 miles northeast of the Hellknight-ruled settlement of Fort Inevitable, the spire is well known to locals and travelers of the region.

Believed to be an Ancient ruin from the era before Skyfall, most think the Emerald Spire refers to the ruins of large tower of green glass that rises above the clearing. However, the spire itself is far more ancient, a needle of  crystal that reaches 50 miles into the earth, into the very vaults of the Lightless Depths.

The spire defended by the Queen's elite sylph guards. The Spire is rumored to stretch into the Fade at the peak of its unthinkable height.
