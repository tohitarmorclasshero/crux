# Red Sea of Rust

The Dustwind
Formed when Eladras fell to Earth.
Eladras was the ancient elven citadel; an enormous tree. It's roots were on the moon, and the furthest tips of its branches brushed the mountaintops of the world.
It survived the Time of Fire and Madness only to later succumb to its own, private apocalypse.
Many of its fragments persist as free-falling orbital biomes. The druids somehow salvaged a seed and used it to grow Aglabendis, the Tree of Beasts, destined to destroy all civilization.
When the pieces fell into the Dustwind, they shattered. Long limbs crossed valleys, each chambered with elven homes and entomo-gardens.
Even with a disaster of that magnitude, many survived. Their homes were shattered, filled with the unreachable corpses of their families. Many were killed as more flaming debris fell from the sky over the next nights.
But even then, they would have survived if Zevernus hadn't found them.

Zevernus
Zevernus is the eponymous Dustwind. He is a Wind, like many other spirits of the air.
Unlike them, he is not of this world. He is a refugee from the Emerald Star, one of 9 stars the Church has identified as moral hazards.
Those who observe the Milk Star for too long become determined to travel there. This desire becomes obsessive and self-destructive, and many of its victims die in the pursuit of this foolish mania.
Sometimes however, the victims leap skyward some nights, and fly away cackling. They're never heard from again.
Star-fools who are restrained from flying to their star eventually go howling mad. After several weeks of this, they eventually die, leaving behind an empty husk and a pool of poisonous green 'milk'.
Zevernus hails from that evil star. He has never been persuaded, befriended, nor coerced into telling what he knows of that place. He spends his days and nights arranging the sand into vast geometric patterns. Whether are or alphabet, no one knows.
He has been described as a 'sucking' wind, rather than the regular 'blowing' winds that we are all familiar with. He has strange powers of desiccation and fossilization. When he discovered the fallen elves, he destroyed them utterly.
He usually doesn't deign to interact with small groups of travelers, unless they interfere with his work.
The Stone Forest is the last remnant of the elven refugees. Half-buried ridges of petrified trees and bodies.
Beneath most of them are the hollow sections of elven construction. Some are chambereds from the original Eladras, with all of their strange wonder and artifice. Other rooms are newer, filled with the hopeful collections of desperate elves, and their fossilized bones.
This place is haunted by enormous, translucent ants. Some say that they are elves who transformed themselves to survive the Dustwind.Whatever the case, the ants sem to be uncannily familiar with elven tech, and are not accosted by protective enchantments or the surviving elven ashakka golems.

The Grinding People
Basically skeletons; they run across the desert in large groups. So named because they constantly grind their teeth and bones. It's the only sound they can make.
If you die here, your corpse is compelled to join them.
Their constant presence drives most travelers to the Highway.

The Highway
Before the Great Tree fell, and perhaps before the arrival of Zevernus, there existed a system of aquaducts.
Now they exist only as a sort of highway across the Rusted Wastes. In some places, you can walk atop them for miles. In others, only the posts remain to guide you across the trackless hills of that place.
Many of the pillars have names and constructed shelters, as the desert has its share of pilgrims. Some of the pillars have shrines.
At least one stylite calls the Highway home, and meditates atop one section. Her name is Vangoda, and she is an excellent source of informaiton about the Dustwind.
And lastly, those who camp on the elevated highway are safe from the Dustwind's most famous danger, the Grinding People.
