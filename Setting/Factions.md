The Pale Raven
Empires rise and fall but the everlasting and always growing knowledge of the Pale Raven endures. It is a wise ruler that seeks such sure counsel. The Pale Raven seeks most that their knowledge survives and grows.

The Endless Serpent
Pleasure cult of "dragon-becomers", hold the secret of turning humans into dragonborn
A mysterious new pleasure cult has arisen among the royals & high clans of the Empire. The Endless Serpent tempts the rich and powerful to join their debauch and free themselves of their worldly goods and influence, donated to the cause of course.
The Endless Serpent encircles the globe. They often takes a more sophisticated and indirect approach to coercion. The goals of the Serpent are many, and seemingly not all nefarious, but no outsider can make head or tails of them.

###### CULT OF GOLDEN WRESTLERS
BY TREY CAUSEY
The Cult of Golden Wrestlers of the Ziggurat of Champions are willing to teach others their divine muscle mysteries. Central to their practice is an amber liquid that enhances the benefit of exercise and the development of mighty thews. Users gain 1-3 points of strength, but only if they continue use at least weekly.
Longterm use (>1 month) requires a saving throw per week, lest the user develop berserker rages at the slightest provocation. Discontinuation leads to this effect subsiding in 2d4 weeks. There are also effects on sexual potency which are longer lasting.

###### POWDER-BORN
BY RAFAEL CHANDLER
Powder-Born despise the dull and colorless lives they led before their first inhale of ouro ("sweet powder"). Ouro, which is made from the ground bones of Rainbow Wyverns, induces psychotic rage, euphoria, and feelings of invulnerability. 
Those who snort it call themselves Powder-Born, and spend much of their time eradicating all traces of their former lives (razing places they lived or worked, killing people former friends or family). 
Their leader Gaurdi Selm is a 9ft ogre with one eye and no teeth, and is very excitable. He collects the hands of musicians, and will pay dearly for more of them.

ORDER OF ST. YIMSIN
BY CHRISTOPHER WEEKS
The waters of St. Yimsin trickle
out of a chalky cliff and gather in a
pool on a wide ledge before drain-
ing back into the local hydrology. 
Something like a thousand years
ago, St. Yimsin and three of her
companions accidentally discovered
the expansive properties of these
waters. Her companions were con-
sumed by their revelations and
passed away after only a few weeks.
St. Yimsin, however, persisted, fad-
ing in and out of contact with the
physical world, and only died after
year and a day, when her mind
could no longer manage the perpet-
ual enlightenment. 
The cult that has grown from
her remaining disciples settled at
the spring and built up a lamasery,
shrine and hospital. Over the years,
the Order of St. Yimsin has devel-
oped a protocol of decoctions and
elixirs that will bring a person expe-
riencing the St. Yimsin's blessing out
of that state and back to the mun-
dane world.
Today, the lamas, monks and
curates of St. Yimsin maintain the
sacred site, seeking wisdom from
the waters, helping pilgrims to do
the same, and treating madness
with unprecedented success. Of
course, to reach the lamasery and
the waters is a long and treacherous
journey from even the nearest city,
either overland or up the river. And
the lamas expect handsome dona-
tions for their services.
24
To take the waters, one lies in
the water for several hours each day
(allowing the worms to enter the
body through pores). Typically on
the third day of treatment (once a
sufficient population of the worms
has taken up residence in the blood
stream), mental and physical alter-
ations become detectable. The heart-
beat races but remains steady in
most cases. The pilgrim grows first
confused and then stuporous (as the
brain enters a fugue state) as they
enter the Blessed Trance. 
Some participants speak during
their trance, sometimes in languages
unknown to all, and sometimes in
their primary language. Others are
entirely passive (representing a
stronger dissociative state). 
The people of St. Yimsin's main-
tain the affected pilgrims commen-
surate with the donation made by
them or in their name. This typical-
ly includes brief attention every
hour or so around the clock,
attempted feedings of broth, period-
ic cleaning of human waste, weekly
baths, etc. 
It may also include one-sided
conversation, musical performance,
poetry recitation, premium feeding
and cleaning, massage, etc. The pil-
grim's goals and ongoing health are
considered and the caretakers make
decisions about when to attempt to
terminate the blessing, bringing the
pilgrim back to the real world. Some
participants stay blessed for only
three days, others for three weeks. 
Some of the lamas are said to be
maintained in blessing for months
or years, but who knows if that's just
marketing hype? (The GM will have
to decide how long any PC is kept in
blessed state but consider at least
the following: PC's Con, PC's Wis,
donation made, and relationship
with the cult.)
When it is time to return, the
caretakers perform rituals that
include feeding herbal decoctions,
spreading gummy elixirs all over
the blessed's skin and the adminis-
tration of a large, leafy suppository.
(These treatments combine to exter-
minate the parasite in the blood
stream that is responsible for the
altered state.) 
When one is drawn back to our
world from the blessed state, it is
stressful and often those most
healthy are most resistant. A per-
centile roll under Con calls for a
save vs. death. The percentile roll
can be modified by +/- 5% depend-
ing on the relationship the PC has
with the cult caretaker.
There is a percent chance equal
to two times the number of days
spent in blessing that each of the fol-
lowing takes place (any combina-
tion of effects, even when seemingly
inconsistent, is possible): 
1. A mental disorder suffered by the blessed is healed (roll for each, if several distinct disorders exist)
2. The blessed experiences vague recollections of ego-death and out-of-body self-observation
3. The blessed experiences personal affirmation and radical self-acceptance, this lightness-of-being leaves them open to refreshed feelings and they have an increased chance of falling in love for 1d6 days.
4. The blessed recalls a personal conversation with their ancestor, discussing the past and their future -- GM and player can agree on details but PC receives a renewed sense of purpose: they gain a new Drive or replace a deprecated one. 
5. Some significant secret about the world around them -- something they care about, is revealed to the blessed (roll for this twice -- 2 different revelations)
6. The blessed experiences significant longing to repeat the experience for 1d6 units of time (1:days, 2:weeks, 3:months, 4:years, 5:decades, 6:lifetimes)
7. The blessed experiences a strong aversion to the experience and will never voluntarily repeat it
8. The blessed knows a new language
9. Some dietary shift takes place for the blessed -- something is a consuming need, something enjoyed can no longer be tolerated, or something else...
10. The blessed feels nothing but dejection
