# Portals

A **portal** is a gateway that directly links one location to another, often by magical or supernatural means. Portals connect locations across great physical distances, and more rarely across time.

Only a rare few know some of the secrets of operating them. However, in recent years portals have taken to spontaneously activating for short periods, apparently at random and for no known reason.

The creators of these portals are unknownâ€”some speculate that the portals may be older than life as we know it. There is a particularly unusual and incomprehensible portal on the remote island of Apostae that might be a message or test left behind by its creators. If so, nobody has solved it.

The arches for which the River Kingdoms town of Sevenarches was named are said to have once served as portals. Kyonin has shown great interest in reclaiming this ancient site, but so far the town's rulers have refused to allow it.

Portals to the Dark Tapestry made of abysium exist in the Darklands.
