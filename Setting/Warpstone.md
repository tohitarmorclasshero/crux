# Warpstone
**Warpstone**, also spelled **warpstone** and alternatively known as "**Wyrdstone**," "**Seer Stone**," "**Blackstone**," "**Foulstone**," & "**Witch Stone**" is a neon, emerald-green crystalline mineral that is actually the solidified form of pure Chaos condensed directly from the Aethyr.
Upon the breakdown of the warp gate, Chaos entered the world in the form of warpstone dust which rained down upon the world, warping many species into monstrous new forms, as well as leaving a far more subtle and insidious mark upon others.
Warpstone is considered by scholars as the ultimate physical manifestation of pure unfiltered magic.
Sometimes the Winds of Magic coalesce into a solid, crystalline form. Warpstone is therefore very rare. 
Powdered Warpstone is sometimes brought south on the unnatural winds of the Northern Wastes, carrying with it a furious storm of wild Dark Magic that sows terror and destruction upon many parts of the southern lands.
Most Warpstone falls to earth in the form of meteorites from the Ring of Siberys, all that remains of the once massive moon.
Warpstone can also be crystallised from a sufficiently powerful current of Dark Magic into small pieces by very powerful sorcerers or magicians.
Being the source of all magic, Warpstone is highly coveted by magicians, alchemists and sorcerers for its ability to turn lead into gold and heal the sick and wounded.
Warpstone meteorites usually have a larger abundance of the substance than ordinary deposits found on the world's surface, but they are sometimes irregular in shape and size, and require refinement before being used in rituals, crafting or to power other magical abilities.
It is difficult to determine the exact physical form most Warpstone takes, but many scholars have noted that nearly all Warpstone has a black and greenish glow to it. Warpstone has no characteristic odour and is slightly warm to the touch. 
In its unrefined form warpstone seems to swallow all light, creating a small patch of darkness around it. It radiates a deadly and corrupting energy; creatures suffering prolonged exposure eventually die or become warped by mutation.
Prolonged consumption produces an addiction much greater than any other natural drug, an addiction that never ceases and will plague its victims for the rest of their lives.
Dwarfs mistrust Warpstone for its chaotic nature and almost never use it. Only one runesmithrunesmith, Alaric the Mad, was able to utilize warpstone for the creation of the Nemesis Crown as a means to hold the Master Rune of Ages. Alaric himself realized the mistake he had made and sealed the Crown away before it could be abused.
Warpstone is not a corrupting force in itself. Rather, it draws the Winds of Magicto it, but since it lacks direction and a guiding will, it crushes them together and thus accumulates Dark Magic. The longer Warpstone resides in the physical world, the more destructive and ridden with dark magic it becomes.
Elves thus eschew the use of Warpstone in favour of "power stones" of their own making, each of which instead draws only a single Wind of Magic to it and crystallizes that lesser force into physical form, without the horrifying effects that are the result of the soldification of true Warpstone.
As Warpstone is one of the substances responsible for the creation of cursed mutants, traffickers of it are targeted by the witchfinders. The fact that it is so rare makes it very valuable for the right circles. A single ounce of warpstone can be enough to buy a duchy.
The most common reason that some misguided fool would seek Warpstone has to do with the legends dating back to the time of the destruction of Mordheim that claim Warpstone can serve as a catalyst in the transmutation of base metals into gold. Other rumors include that it can cure all sicknesses, heal any wound and even bring the dead back to life.
No realm has as great a use for or need of Warpstone then the great Skaven Under-Empire. The role of Warpstone in Skaven society is diverse, serving as a source of energy for their twisted magic, advanced technology, and even as a key ingredient to be used in their breeding and mutation experiments. Skaven have been known to incorporate Warpstone into a piece of armour or jewellery to add a magical property to their otherwise mundane gear.
Warpstone has also been used by the Skaven as an ingredient in magical potions or deadly poisons. It is widely used as a form of currency within Skaven society, in the shape of Warpstone Tokens -- refined and minted coins made entirely of pure Warpstone.
As a form of pure Dark Magic, Warpstone is a valuable resource for necromancers & vampires. 
Warpstone is often formed in regions in which the undead are or have been active.
Warpstone is concentrated life-force or soulfire that is inherent in all living beings and is later drawn into the Aethyr to be consumed by demons or gods.
Warpstone, however, is cut off from the Aethyr and can continue to exist without magic present. 
It cannot be influenced by the will of any god or Daemon. In that, von Carstein sees it as a perfect manifestation of necromancy itself, which also aims to create magical structures that exist independently from the Aethyr.
Dark magic can coalesce into warpstone and throughout history, comets of warpstone have fallen to the earth, the largest often creating vast craters suffused with corrupting magical energy and the skaven are said to be able call down meteors showers.
The Skaven make many and varied items with Warpstone or are powered by it, these include:
- Black Arc
- Doomwheel
- Plague Censer
- Poisoned Wind
- Screaming Bell
- Skavenbrew
- Warpfire Throwers 
- Warpscrolls
- Warpstone Charms
- Weeping Blades
