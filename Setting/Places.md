1. Laketown: anarchic archipelago of raft-neighborhoods built Venice-style in the volcanic caldera called the Lake of Steam. Evokes Neverwinter, Waterdeep, Rivendell, and Greyhawk, Ontario townships, Jewel cities, micro-city-states, homesteads, feels like "great grass sea" can't swim it long-term because too hot.

5. City of Brass: mountain-sized pyramid arkology-city-districts of the dwarfs, Darklands novel, self-sustaining ecosystems gone wrong, blight/morlocs from below, dwarfs dug too deep; evokes Ravnica, Trantor.
6. Spire: cliff-built on the wall of a former beanstalk (destroyed by Illmorrow castle during crash); feels like Magnimar / Ptolus / MinasTirith.



Cyber-knights: hero-knight-wannabe in intelligent exosuits, suits choose their user, evokes Imperial space marines, glitterboys, Flight of the Navigator, etc. the suit is their paladin mount.

Dryad: witches can warg/enrobe into plant-construct to make Swamp-Thing, plant-bender guy from Soggy Bottom Swamp in Avatar.

Forest village named for defunct nuclear-blast-stack which may or might not be a large orbital cannon dug into the ground for use with conventional explosive igniters (manhole cover to space).

###### The Gift / Nerath / Bael-Turath / Ashlands (radioactive ash)
When humans won their freedom, the Dwarf Kingdom granted them a great boon, the hills of their hinterland were passed in good-will and friendship and called the Gift. There humans built 7 cities on 7 hills and forged a new way of life for themselves. It was only a generation before everything fell to ruin. Corruption, decadence, cruelty, and the Rain of Colorless Fire darkened that country until now it's only spoken of in whispers. Pray you never see their grotesque & twisting spires on the horizon, for by then it is too late: you are in _Hell_: Bael-Turath.

#### Houses of the Blooded
- **Achazriel**, the Destroyer's House, claims connection to one of Bael Turath's greatest generals, who ended the ten-year siege of the Arkhosian citadel of Razortear with an army of ten thousand slave
- **Kahlir**, the House of Blood, had long and gruesome ties to necromancy and vampires, with claims that its true descendants actually bear vampiric blood
- **Dreygu**, the House of Love, is essentially Romeo and Juliet... if they were both tieflings and had the cunning to outwit those out for their blood, marry, and reign over a pleasure-garden
- **Khanebor**, the House of Feasting, which has a reputation so sinister that even tieflings don't want to claim relation
- **Zannifer**, the Red House, whose descendants claim variously to be the survivors of a noble family nearly made extinct by murderous brigands and thus cursed to always wear red unless they regularly slay criminals, or of a murderous brigand who claimed membership in the house by deceit
- **Zolfura**, the House of Ice and Fire, known for its mastery of elemental magic and their emotions.

## Eye in the North
In the furthest north, beyond the boundaries of sanity and the laws of nature, stands the wrecked chaos gate, oozing darkness and spewing forth mutating, magical energy: the raw stuff of Chaos. It is a bleeding wound, a tear in the fabric of reality, a gateway to another dimension.
This portal opened into the dimension of pure energy that was then called the Empyrean, and later called the Warp or the Fade.
The shattered Gate of Heaven appears as a great golden ring encircled by massive & unfathomable starmetal machineries, dwarfing the mountains around it. It is covered in runes of unimaginable potency, that glow in the darkness, their dancing shapes altering reality. From the dark reaches of the warpgate pours out the Winds of Magic and mutating clouds of warpstone dust -- magical energy transmuted into a dense solid.
Whether due to enemy attack or structural failure, the eldritch machineries of the gate crashed down upon the world in a burning hail of star-metal. Simultaneously, the north pole imploded, opening rifts into the beyond, and Chaos spewed forth from the spirit realm.
Meteors of warpstone left weirdling contrails that set the skies aflame. The planet shuddered under thunderous impacts, with some burrowing like animals deep into the world's foundation. A layer of warpstone dust was cast into the air, its mutating properties causing untold atrocities.
