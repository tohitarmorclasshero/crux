Zorya
'Angels'
**Zorya** (lit. "Dawn"; also many variants: **Zarya**, **Zara**, **Zaranitsa**, **Zoryushka**, etc.) is a figure in Slavic folklore, a goddess & daughter of the sun. In different tales, Zorya has between 1 and 4 different aspects, appearing at different times of the day.
The Morningstar, the Evenstar, the Midday Sun, and the Nightstar. Depending on tradition, she may appear as a singular entity, often called "The Red Maiden", or up to 4 sisters at once. Although Zorya is etymologically unrelated to the Proto-Indo-European goddess of the dawn [H₂éwsōs], she shares most of her characteristics. She is often depicted as an aspect of or sister to [Zvezda] the [Morning Star]. She lives in the Palace of the Sun, opens the gate for him in the morning so that he can set off on a journey through the sky, guards his white horses, she is also described as virginal or pure. In the Eastern Slavic tradition of [zagovory] folk magic she represents the supreme power that a practitioner appeals to.
