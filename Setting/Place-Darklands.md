# Place-The Darklands & Below

The **Darklands** are an endless maze of immense caverns, vaults, and passages that can be found beneath the surface. While entrance to the Darklands can be found throughout the world, it is uncommon for surface dwellers to venture into the perilous depths, making the subterranean realm a world unto itself.

The subterranean realms can be divided roughly into 3 layers, each with their own characteristics, inhabitants, and hazards:

The uppermost is the Darklands, loosely defined as the first 2 miles in depth. This region consists of countless interconnected cave networks, some of which are linked through long twisting passages. While the caverns span great distances, they do not run the length of continents.
For a cave system to be considered part of the true Darklands, there must be a passage leading down to the next region: Endless Gulf.
The Darklands cavern systems do not form a continuous network, and travel between them often requires passing through the Endless Gulf or over the surface. Some regions are almost entirely isolated from the rest of the Darklands.
The massive quakes caused by Skyfall caused tremendous upheaval in the Darklands. Massive vault systems collapsed, many of them inhabited by orks & dwarves. The dwarves viewed these quakes as a sign, and started a great pilgrimage to the surface known as the Quest for Sky. Over the course of the centuries, they continued their war with the orks, driving the creatures ahead of them until the great majority no longer dwelled in the Darklands.
Some of the dwarven brethren chose to stay behind in their great underground cities, refusing to give up their ancestral homelands; the descendants of these dwarves became the derro, overcome with madness.
With devastation on the surface, many humans fled to the Darklands in hopes of finding refuge in the deep and dark; but the strange isolation and slavery under the derro eventually transformed them into horrible reflections of humanity; morlocks.
Now the Darklands is mostly populated entirely by the Skaven UnderEmpire, but also small enclaves and fortress-vaults of deeper creatures like derro (ghouls) and their morlock slaves. The Blight and the Nightmares Below remain a significant threat at all levels of the Darklands, and incursions are only thing that can distract groups from fighting each other.
Many creatures that dwell in the Darklands are relatively isolated and tribal, and are generally found in small groups. The skaven and derro are the only creatures that could be said to have functioning civilizations.
Scattered amongst the sprawling complexes are a number of systems that function as population centers for some of the inhabitants of the Darklands. In particular, the derro occupy the lion's share of abandoned dwarven complexes.
Places of interest include:
- Bloodcleft: a shaft beneath the that has a floor of razor-sharp rock.
- Diepkamer: secret fortress of the 7 Patriarchs of the derro, said to never be in the same place twice.
- The Long Walk: a mile-wide rift that leads down to The Endless Gulf at the Midnight Mountains in the Endless Gulf.
- The Midnight Jungle: a fungus jungle infested with mushroomen that spills into some region of the Endless Gulf below.

**The Endless Gulf** is the middle realm of the Darklands, below the shallow tunnels of the upper region, and more well-known than the Lightless Depths. This region consists of vast and seemingly unending underground galleries taller than any mountain, and its caverns span continents. Found here are massive chambers, great underground rivers, and almost unfathomable seas. Most entrances to the Endless Gulf go through the upper region first, but there are a few deviations, such as Mobhad Leigh. The Endless Gulf starts at a depth of about 3 miles and is said to extend to 50 miles in some areas.
The Endless Gulf was mostly spared from the destruction wrought by the fall of the moon, unlike the caverns above.
While the greatest denizens of The Gulf are now the derro, at one time the troglodytes were the primary species in the region. They had withdrawn from the surface world due to their war with the Elf-King and established great underground cities. Here they hibernated for several millennia. 
Starting in the Age of Darkness, others settled the great spaces in The Endless Gulf. The dwarves who would eventually become the derro established the civilization of Nemret Noktoria, settling near large deposits of an ore called lazurite, while gugs were brought to the planet by the Rough Beast. The aquatic species called mindflayers, freed from their servitude to the aboleth by the breaking of their masters' undersea civilization, migrated to the Sunken Pillars, underground lakes, and oceans of The Endless Gulf. Fleeing the destruction of their homeland, some humans came here and devolved into the creatures now called morlocks.
Of the 3 layers of the Darklands, The Endless Gulf can be considered the most densely populated. The inhabitants of the upper region congregate in a large tunnels separated by hundreds of miles of "wilderness" of hard-to-navigate passageways, while the Lightless Depths are contained ecosystems with little to no contact with one another. The Endless Gulf may have its wilderness too, but the 3 great civilizations of this layer, the derro, mindflayers, and gug, each hold dominion over hundreds of miles.
