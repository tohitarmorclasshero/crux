# Monster-Intellect Devourer

Psychic body snatchers to whom no experience is too extreme and no flesh is sacred, **intellect devourers** are one of the strangest, most mysterious races of the Darklands. Using their ability to compress their body, intellect devourers crawl through the eye sockets of helpless creatures, consume and replace the spinal cord and nerves, then assume control of the brain and body.
