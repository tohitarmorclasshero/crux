# No Such Fox
There's No Such Thing As Foxes
from goblinpunch.blogspot.com 2017-09

Foxes are imaginary creatures that exist only in dreams. For reasons they can't explain, everyone knows what a fox looks like, but no one can ever remember having seen one.
They're mythical beasts, existing only in heraldry, rumor, and fraud -- there are many ways to dye a dog.
They're believed to bring good luck, confidence, glibness, and then ill fortune (in that order). Potions made from fox's tongues are said to exist, but there's no agreement as to what -- if anything -- they actually do.
Common wisdom maintains that foxes have never existed. They are simply something that stepped out of myth, an inversion of a dog. Where their progenitors are large and direct, the brightly colored foxes are small and clever.
Even their coloration is inverted; where a dog is a drab brown or grey, foxes are depicted in brilliant oranges, reds, and sometimes with exotic patterns (such as paisley).
And while most believe foxes have never existed, there are a few who believe they were once real animals that succeeded in making themselves imaginary.
According to them, foxes exist all around us, stealing our food and warming themselves in our beds.
Their magic makes them impossible to notice, remember, or record. All trains of causality that might lead to their discovery are brushed away with a whisk of a fox's tail.
They say that the foxes once enacted some powerful magic to make themselves disappear from all observation, memory, and thought. At the center of this powerful magic was a stone called the Foxenstone, a monolith that towered over the trees, its surface was covered with spirals of foxes, running to its apex.
It was made from gold, or amber, or perhaps a reddish salt that was poisonous to cats.
And while many things about the Foxenstone are hotly debated, its location is not: it's located in the Foxenfort, above the Foxenport, in Foxentown, on Foxenisle, on the western wendings of the Bearded Ocean, not too far from Trystero, where men have learned be become giants.
There is only one catch.
A visitor touring the Foxenfort will be entirely unable to catch sight of the Foxenstone, which by most accounts is 40ft tall and stands in the center of the fort's courtyard. The locals will wink and tell you that it's there all right, it's just very well hidden. Do you see any foxes? Of course not. If you saw either, then the foxes would not have done a very good job, would they?
In Foxenport, you can buy a fragment of the Foxenstone to take home. To the untrained eye, these appear to be rustic wooden keepsake boxes: completely empty.
The 6119 foxes carved on the side of the Foxenstone are well-described, and ownership of the foxes is a well-regulated business. They are even traded among the nobles as a form of currency. Since the transactions are all immaculately recorded by the Foxentown Bank, there is never any discrepancy. You can buy a fox near the bottom for as little as 5000$, while the foxes near the top command much higher prices.
Carved foxes on the sides of an imaginary stone are not an accepted currency anywhere else in the world, but in Foxentown, they're as good as gold. Better, actually, since it shows a certain willingness to engage with the imaginary economy.
Lastly, those who doubt the existence of the Foxenstone would be wise to direct their attention to a single, extremely convincing fact: Foxentown is impossible to locate except by those who have already been there.
Bear in mind, that Foxentown is a bustling port filled with merchants speaking a half-dozen different languages, and exchanging the flotsam from a hundred different cities. Because of this, it isn't hard to get to Foxentown. You have only to venture into any seedy harborside flophouseand ask if anyone is interesting in "chasing the little foxes" and some congested whaler will speak up. He's been a dozen times; he loves the way the morning sun reflects off the beautiful Foxenstone.
He'll guide you there for a pittance (if he doesn't die from fever first), and you will invariably be disappointed. Despite the legends, Foxentown appears to be just another warm-water shantytown, filled with robbers, whores, and mosquitoes.
