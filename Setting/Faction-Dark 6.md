THE DEVOURER
"Sovereign of Wave and Whelm", Neutral Evil
The Devourer is often associated with his sister, Arawai: Just as Arawai is the deity of the natural world, the Devourer is the lord of nature’s destructive side. Civilized folk might pray to Arawai for a bountiful harvest, but they also beseech her brother to protect that harvest from flooding and drought. The Devourer is also god of the deep. The ocean waves are his sole purview, and any sailor (regardless of alignment or beliefs) would be wise to pay at least lip service to his power. In this capacity, the god finds worshipers among the lizardfolk, sahuagin, and other aquatic races.
**Portfolio**: Devastation, Hunger, Nautical Travel, Storms, Water.
**Domains**: Cold, Destruction, Pestilence, Ocean, Water, Weather.
**Priest Training**: Priests of the Devourer are familiar with nature in general, and with water and storms in particular. Most were fishers, sailors, or slaves before becoming priests.
**Quests**: The Devourer’s faithful quest to rescue those lost at sea, end or cause drought, or protect rivers and lakes from the unworthy (even if it means destroying them).
**Prayers and Rites**: Sacrifices to the Devourer involve immersion in water; grim stories abound of living creatures tossed into maelstroms. Vassals entreat the god to cease flooding or drought, and to show mercy when they are lost at sea.
**Shrines**: Shrines to the Devourer are usually built of wood, and many are roofless, allowing rain to enter freely. Others are built on the water itself, either on lakeside barges or in the cabins of seafaring vessels. They stink of blood and are hung with rotting seaweed.
**Favored Weapon**: Trident.
**Holy Symbol**: A bundle of five sharpened bones.

THE FURY
“The Sovereign of Rage and Ruin,” Neutral Evil
Daughter to Arawai and the Devourer, the Fury is a deity of passion driven to extremes. She is patron to all who allow their passions to consume them, regardless of who they worship. Her followers cultivate passion and righteousness among the so-called “civilized,” to better spread the influence of their god. The Fury watches over barbarians everywhere, as well as certain types of artists, crafters, and bards. She is also the deity of favor among many intelligent monsters.
**Portfolio**: Anger, Extremism, Passion, Revenge.
**Domains**: Liberation, Hatred, Passion, Wrath.
**Priest Training**: In all matters, the Fury’s priests are passionate. They must have an intimate understanding of pain and loss. Many were bereaved during the Last War, and many fought in it.
**Quests**: The Fury demands her followers inflame passion by every means possible to break down the strictures of formality and custom.
**Prayers and Rites**: The Fury’s rites are deeply personal affairs. Sacrifices almost always involve bloodshed, sometimes on the part of the petitioner, sometimes not. One word that never describes any rite conducted in the Fury’s name is “somber.”
**Shrines**: Shrines to the Fury are as varied as her worshipers. Among certain drow sects, temples are strangely elaborate and meticulously maintained. By contrast, a monstrous shrine might be little more than a pile of bones, with fresh kills piled regularly on top.
**Favored Weapon**: Claws.
**Holy Symbol**: A red-and-black, winged wyrm with a woman’s head and upper body.

THE KEEPER
“The Sovereign of Death and Decay,” Neutral Evil
Another of the second divine generation, the Keeper is the son of Olladra and Onatar, and the flip side to his twin brother, Kol Korran. Where his brother is the patron of material wealth, the Keeper governs shameless greed and gluttony. He is the hunger in the dark, clutching at anyone or anything that strays too far from the light. It is said that of all the gods, he alone can waylay the deceased on their journey to Dolurrh, and no soul once ensnared can escape the Keeper’s chill embrace. He is the patron of death cults all over Eberron, and in this capacity, has become the unofficial god of the religious necromancer.
**Portfolio**: Death, Entropy, Greed, Hunger, Time.
**Domains**: Death, Decay, Greed, Hunger, Pact.
**Priest Training**: Servants of the Keeper must have a working knowledge of life and death; disturbingly, many of his priests were once healers.
**Quests**: Quests in the Keeper’s name often consist of killing someone or something specific, usually with a Keeper’s fang weapon (ECS 226), but some revolve around discovering some mystery or acquiring an item of great value.
**Prayers and Rites**: Sacrifices to the Keeper almost always require ending life in his name. They range from breaking a rabbit’s neck to beheading multiple sentient creatures, depending on the importance of the rite.
**Shrines**: The Keeper’s shrines are constructed of stone, and many are underground, in tombs, or both. Personal shrines often include a decorated skull.
**Favored Weapon**: Scythe.
**Holy Symbol**: A Khyber dragonshard in the general shape of a fang.

THE MOCKERY
“The Sovereign of Betrayal and Bloodshed,” Neutral Evil
This evil deity, known in some circles as the Betrayer, is brother to Dol Arrah and Dol Dorn. His betrayal lead to his flaying and banishment from the Sovereign Host. Once part of the triumvirate of combat deities that included his brothers, the Mockery now represents the dark side of their portfolios. He is the god of dishonorable combat and unjust war, and is patron to all manner of evil warriors and rogues. Assassin cults, of which the most infamous is the Flayed Hand (Player’s Guide to Eberron 108), keep him in their prayers.
**Portfolio**: Combat, Dishonor, Murder, Terror, Treachery.
**Domains**: Destruction, Domination, Illusion, Trickery, War.
**Priest Training**: Priests of the Mockery must know betrayal personally, and thus must bring to ruin someone close to them before entering the priesthood. They are also expected to learn something of anatomy and surgery.
**Quests**: The Mockery’s adherents often exact bloody vengeance on those who have wronged them or their god. They also seek to destroy the priesthoods of both Dol Arrah and Dol Dorn—corrupting a priest of either god earns the Mockery’s highest favor.
**Prayers and Rites**: The Mockery is often invoked just before a killing, whether through assassination or armed combat. Sacrifices usually consist of things valued by the petitioner’s enemies, perhaps a trusted weapon or beloved mount.
**Shrines**: The Mockery’s shrines are downright ghastly, more charnel pits than temples. Bloody chains dangle from the ceiling, and the walls are hung with strips of skin. Rather than cleaning up blood spilled in the god’s name, priests treat it chemically to retain its fresh color and viscosity, so that shrines seem literally coated in blood.
**Favored Weapon**: Sickle.
**Holy Symbol**: Five blood-spattered tools, laid out in the rough shape of the divine Octogram of the Host.

THE SHADOW
“The Sovereign of Magic and Mayhem,” Chaotic Evil
If Dol Arrah represents the light of the mortal soul, the Shadow is the darkness within. The literal shadow of Aureon, it acquired both sentience and godhood as the cosmic price paid by its creator for arcane knowledge. It is a god of ambition, corruption, and dark magic, and evil spellcasters the world over conduct foul rituals in its name. The Shadow is the progenitor of the medusas, and patron to a great many other monster races, especially in Droaam, where its worship is most popular. Legends say that were Aureon and his shadow to be once again united, the age of civilized peoples would come to an end.
**Portfolio**: Magic, Consequence, Corruption, Darkness, Duality.
**Domains**: Chaos, Darkness, Magic, Mind, Shadow.
**Priest Training**: The Shadow’s priests must have some knowledge of both magic and the natural world, and many are equally proficient with both arcane and divine magic.
**Quests**: Followers quest to unearth ancient and forbidden lore, lead good people into temptation, or twist things of the natural world to suit selfish ends.
**Prayers and Rites**: The Shadow is invoked in the name of ambition or discovery, especially arcane insight. The god prefers offerings of great value, whether it be personal bloodletting or destroying a precious gem or magic item.
**Shrines**: The Shadow’s favored stone is obsidian, and it forms his highest temples. Though the glassy mineral is difficult to work, the priesthood’s facility with arcane magic makes the task of construction easier.
**Favored Weapon**: Quarterstaff.
**Holy Symbol**: A block of obsidian in the shape of a tower.

THE TRAVELER
“The Sovereign of Chaos and Change,”
Chaotic Neutral
The most mysterious of the Nine-and-Six, the Traveler is neither child nor parent to any other god in the collected pantheon. It is the only god said to walk the face of Eberron in body, as well as in spirit, but its mastery of form prevents any mortal from recognizing it. The sovereign of cunning, invention, and transformation, the Traveler is patron to all who embrace change, whether physical or philosophical. Changelings, doppelgangers, lycanthropes, and shifters view the Traveler as the highest god.
**Portfolio**: Chaos, Deception, Evolution, Invention, Transformation.
**Domains**: Artifice, Celerity, Chaos, Charm, Creation, Liberation, Travel, Trickery.
**Priest Training**: The Traveler’s priests are consummate deceivers. Many were artisans or other inventors before donning the cloth of change.
**Quests**: Priests of the Traveler often go on long journeys, sometimes to deliver messages or objects, often to produce change by upsetting the social order in some way. At other times, they wander without apparent purpose. Some are called upon to adopt alternative identities, often for years at a time, to aid in their subversive efforts.
**Prayers and Rites**: Sacrifices to the Traveler require the petitioner to create something and then destroy that creation in the god’s name, thereby proving willingness to accept change and transformation. Nearly all Vassals pray to the Traveler before embarking on long or perilous voyages. 
**Shrines**: Shrines to the Traveler have no consistent make or design. Each worshiper is expected to create a personal place of worship and to alter it regularly.
**Favored Weapon**: Scimitar.
**Holy Symbol**: An eight-pointed configuration of 4 crossed and rune-inscribed bones.
