The Fade  
An alternate dimension of purely psychic energy that echoes and underlies the familiar 4 dimensions of the material universe. It is the source of magic, and home of so-called "chaos gods" and myriad demonic entities. In fact, the terms "Chaos" and "the Warp" are often used interchangeably.  
The Immaterium is believed to be the direct result of the existence of sentience in the material world, in particular the intelligent species. Considered to be a dark reflection of the material universe, the Warp is an ocean of chaotic psychic energy, raw emotion given meta-physical form by the thoughts, dreams, and memes of thinking creatures. Stirred by strong emotion and action, the Fade is the true Realm of Chaos, home to the Dark Gods who comprise the Ruinous Powers and their legions of slave spirits.  
  
The Thin Veil  
The barrier between reality and the Fade is not equally strong across the world. In some places, the veil is thin, allowing the influence of the Warp to leech through. Such areas might be permanent or temporary, and could be of nearly any size, the result of random chance or the intentional acts of malefic cults. Some are the result of experiments performed in the Dark Ages, while others are a side effect of magic activity or a great effusion of powerful emotion or death.  
Various disturbing phenomena can manifest in areas where the Veil is thin, for the Fade and its influence are never predictable or consistent. Such places are often considered haunted or ill-omened, for people might hear voices, glimpse movement out of the corner of their eyes, or experience nightmares or even waking visions. Time might run backwards, temperatures plummet or fluctuate; individuals might feel a sense of wrongness that they can't describe or strange and disturbing sensations, from tingling skin to the smell of burned flesh.  
  
Technology Lies Beneath the Earth  
Before history, there was something. People lived, and died, and created wonders of magic and technology that cannot be replicated today. Many empires rose and fell, thousands of years ago. Their creations still work, and are hard fought-over.  
  
The World is Filled With Terrible Monsters  
Despite efforts to tame the land and secure its borders, the world remains a dangerous place. Savage beasts, many which possess strange and unnatural powers, stalk the wild places. No matter the efforts civilization makes to drive back these threats, they return again and again, each time in greater numbers.  
  

Life Is Hard For Humans  
Barbarian humans live in the thousand needles, for which they are called the thousand tribes. It's dark, temperate to cold, often snows at night but the snow only lasts in winter, soggy, travel is difficult, decent communication is slow,  
They believe not in gods, but their own heroic ancestors. Pele a volcanic creature of smoke and ash, watches from her fiery throne. The humans don't know if she's a god, but humans destroyed a whole nation of their gods, what have they to fear from another?  
Many humans stole the dwarves stone ships and escaped religious persecution during dwarf religious schism, and dwarves retaliated with magic storm, crashing ships into thousand needles area  
Humans have such a shitty place in dwarf society because of rigid and calcified caste system, dwarves don't really understand them as individuals--more like children, and because alienage ghettoization, and because violent religious schism happened during their early integration in the city, their place is "somewhere above casteless... maybe with servants or merchants..." Humans are essentially free to choose a caste but once they do they have to navigate it's politics and nepotism and racism and--at least according to dwarfs--can't ever change their mind since caste is considered divine calling/inspiration, humans have to denounce their pagan ways and get dwarf religion to live in the city  
Normal human magic requires observing taboos like truenames and veganism  
Humans stole elven ships and traded them as war tech to dwarves in trade for their lives during the war  
Thousand needles is alpine marshy area dominated by stone needles  
The was a short gilded age for humans before the undead showed up, where a long Arthur like king ruled but was fatally wounded or lost at sea never to be seen again, the undead soon tore down any semblance of large scale organized government, they target the largest population centers so humans had to decentralize and spread out into their ancestral tribes, fighting for basic survival needs  
Human faith is Weaver-vs-Wyrm/druidism with a dash of mythical heroes like Norse/Greek/African figures like Anansi, or Finn MacCool, or Morrigan, or Freyja, or Hercules, and involves lots of psychotropic drugs and blood sacrifice. Mythical heroes are usually people who were (supposedly) important historical heroes who bargained with spirits, won great battles, tricked gods, come back from seeming dead, etc. but who usually end tragically dead or exiled or just go missing in the wilderness, which is why it wasn't unusual for their king to be missing for over a hundred years and there to still be hope that he might come back, for those that believe strongly. Their stories continue to grow and change and adapt. It's one of the few things that hold human communities together anymore because travel is so dangerous in the thousand needles.  
Centaurs and unicorns exist in the human mythology because their pre-slave ancestors had uplifted horses. All the horses died because of an aggressive plague, which also killed their primary predator, lions.  
Humans in dwarf lands mostly live on estates as indentured workers, but large swaths live in the Lucre shanty sprawl just outside the city walls. Humans are tolerated, but sit uneasily somewhere within the servant caste and/or casteless in popular dwarven opinion. Humans aren't truly recognized by the seons that patrol and enforce dwarf law; they're viewed as something between an object or pet. So they can get away with crimes that dwarfs cannot, and are both expendable and deniable. Humans should be wary however of summary destruction for grievous bodily harm to dwarfs or other high crimes and felonies.  
  

Elves Are Weird and Dead  
First dark elf (one who turned away from her kind) and last living elf is the Raven Queen, who was named after the first natural creatures humans had ever seen, and why Raven is another name for black.  
Elves were matriarchal because females could birth actual monsters, they could mentally recombine DNA inside themselves, which is why they are called vampires, they need gene seed and blood and sex  
Powerful enough elves became daedra-like creatures, which are chaos patrons for shortcut-hungry sorcerers. They exist within the warp hiding from She Who Thirsts.  
Elf priests were skilled dreamwalkers and controlled a complex communication system of sleeping auto-didacts. It is these sleepers who became the fey overlords. It's rumored that if you could find their bodies you could finally kill them. Otherwise they are comp  
Elves ruled their empire from another planet. Their main hq in this sector was the moon. The humans and elves on the planet were on the colonial frontier of their polity. But the moon was not what it seemed; it was no mere planetoid, but a cosmic egg, incubating a child of the Great Devourer. It waited patiently, forging itself on the elves dreams and turning them them sick and twisted. Finally, in the orgy of blood at the height of the Elder War, the Deceiver burst forth from its rocky shell destroying the mantle of the moon and raining doom upon the world and death on the elves and humans.  
  

Dwarfs  
Dwarfs have no real necks and are built like power lift competitors.  
Dwarf magic requires energy accumulation, a magic pool maintained by their alma mater that they are licensed to access, hence rigid hierarchy and level-based wizards, the worst politics and factionalism of academia  
Dwarf religious schism was result of most of all of the noble caste and most warriors dying in war with elves, leaving only merchants and artists, and servants to fight over hierarchy; artists won, but they're so caught up in their own internal vendettas that the merchants really run things day to day  
Dwarf religion was discovered by a warrior-caste dwarf on way back from elf war, based on codified meritocracy, Mithraism-y type thing with fire and light, and early-type catholic-ness, with cultural baggage of machismo that is maintained by church but has little textual or theological support; former religion was shared with humans and elves; ultimate symbol of dwarf faith and power is gigantic energy Kaiju-type things which the church maintains are divine avatars of of their god and the disk-shaped Furies which maintain law within the city (but only for dwarf citizens; humans have their own police forces which are little more than armed mafia thugs controlled by dwarf merchant banks which control and exploit human neighborhoods).  
Portion of ruined dwarf city has wyvern-in-the-well.  
Dwarfs are native to the planet, but were subject to a terrible plague that wiped out 90% of their pop. They lost their sacred city in the mountains to some underground threat that still bothers them to this day in the deep roads below the Last City.  
The First and Last City, or just Last City, was their first metropolis, and imperial capital. Over time and changing tactical and economics realities, it lost status and prestige until the capital was moved to another holier city in the mountainous interior and the Last City became the province of the merchant caste as a main seaport and trade hub for the region. Known as a mean and desperate place at the height of the empire. When the empire finally collapsed under the weight of a horrible plague and 2 war fronts, the few survivors fled to the Last City and sealed the Deep Roads behind them, dooming all those they left behind.  
The City of Spires  
  
Sin Is Real  
Sins are physical, jealousy turns u into a cyclops, arrogance turns u into a dragon, rage turns u into a manticore, greed turns u into a ratling. The influence of Chaos and the Fade are real and physical, but often unseen and rare. Average people think these things are myths or the ravings of ignorant rubes or the manipulations of grasping religious leaders.  
  

The Daedra  
Goblins are the twisted remains of kidnap victims stolen by fae overlords from their cribs; when the overlords get bored they abandon them to survive on their own in semi-wild feral tribes in the fairy world, sometimes the overlords will cow these tribes into submission long enough to use them as disposable minions and go-fors, the Goblin King especially is famous for this because as a male he lacks the power to influence the female-oriented power structures in the fey courts acting as little more than a petty tyrant with delusions of true power and civility (he is doomed to rely on the iron fist, too impatient and too clumsy to use the more subtle arts of power); his political reach exceeds his grasp for now  
There is a mist creature employed by the overlords for their wild hunts, that's why it's always dark and foggy and people get confused and turned around; it's an active monster effect  
The fact that fey seem to be all elves is simply because so many died so suddenly and violently. There are just as many or more older non Elf Fey. Fey are demons, or gaki. Former mortals driven mad in death; whether intentionally or not they inflict their own pain and suffering on mortals around them.
