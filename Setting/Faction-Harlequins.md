# Faction-Harlequins

###### Harlequins
*Scope*: Brass Cities, Jade Hell.
*Influence*: Minimal, Undercover
*Mandate*: Gather info, maintain human traditions & culture

The Cult of Harlequins see no distinction between art and war, their outlook best explained by reference to the legend of the Rain of Colorless Fire; 1 of their self-appointed duties is to keep the stories of human culture & history alive through traveling performance. The warrior-artists are rumored to possess mysterious powers, and many believe that they know most -- if not all -- the secret paths through the endless maze of the Webway, even to the depths of the Black Library itself. The central figure of Harlequin belief is the Great Harlequin, the so-called Laughing God Cegorach. His will alone is the only authority they recognize, their every deed thought to be but a ploy in his inscrutable agenda. No druid welcomes them except for the Gatekeepers, who remain carefully ambivalent.
