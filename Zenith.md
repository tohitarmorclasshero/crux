# Zenith

#### Gods at the Source
All magic in Zenith flows from the Divine Age. As in Greek mythology, all supernatural or fantastical elements in Zenith -- monsters, magic, even your heroic powers -- are believed to ultimately stem from the time of gods & titans.

#### Ancient Magic
Though the spells you will be casting in Zenith are familiar, the style of magic is mythical rather than medieval. To this end, we encourage you to instil your spells with mythic flavor; instead of the spell spirit guardians conjuring angelic figures, it could instead summon a host of spectral hoplites, the spirits of your ancestors or fallen comrades, their arms & armor still scarred & pitted from their final battle.

#### More Precious Than Gold
Zenith has very little metal available for tools. Many weapons, armor, & items are different than those you would find in traditional fantasy. Instead of rapiers & crossbows in Zenith, expect spears & slings.
