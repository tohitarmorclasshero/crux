# Odyssey of the Dragon Lords

#### Gods & Kings
Mythic heroes have dealings with powerful supernatural beings, almost as a matter of course; these 'gods' are rarely nice. They're jealous, capricious, cruel, generous, vengeful, kind, vicious, forgetful, thoughtless, lusty, selfish, passionate, & generally all-too-human in their passions. They don't know everything & can't control everything, but within their spheres of influence they are awesome, terrible, & dangerous. It’s a foolish mortal who disrespects them. The wisest acknowledge the power of the gods over every aspect of life. Mythic heroes must also contend with the will of mortal kings & queens. Earth-shattering events demand action from the most powerful rulers from across the land, but their hands are often bound by the vagaries of fate. Sometimes, they are forced to take up arms & join the quest themselves, but more often they must depend upon the might of famous heroes.

#### Oaths & Curses
Mythic heroes are often bound to their quest by powerful oaths. Oaths are inviolable sacred vows that are meant to be sworn only in the most serious of circumstances. Oaths have a powerful, far-reaching effect on society. They may create peace between gods, promote unbreakable fellowships, & even instigate brutal wars. No reasonable mortal dares break an oath, lest they be afflicted with calamity. To be cursed by the gods is to be reviled by the land itself. Food turns to dust in your mouth, harpies peck out your eyes, & your soul is dragged screaming into the Underworld. Even the bravest heroes fear the consequences of oath-breaking. The gods are literally incapable of breaking their oaths, for they are made from the same ancient magic that binds & enforces them.

#### Fame & Hubris
All great heroes seek fame & glory. No mere vanity, fame is essential to achieving your goals. Famous heroes can summon warrior allies, influence public opinion, & even demand audiences with kings & gods. Though seeking it is perilous, fame is the most direct route to immortality & power. But there is a dark side to fame: hubris. Excessive pride has been the undoing of many famous heroes before you, and many who will come after. Do not overestimate yourself or underestimate your enemies.

#### Fate & Prophecy
Heroes are subject to the forces of Fate & Prophecy in equal measure. Fate directs the lives of both creatures -- gods & mortals --  & though she is the greatest mystery of all, she can also be cruel. Her greatest gift is Prophecy; which reveals paths that would otherwise be hidden to us -- which allow us to rise to our Fate, rather than be crushed by it. Such paths are dangerous, & walking them might seem mad, but that is the task of true heroes. To dismiss Prophecy & spurn Fate is the greatest Hubris.

#### Comedy & Tragedy
In the end, the story of a hero falls into 2 categories. Those who rise to their Fate, honor their Oaths, and win fame may be forced to make terrible sacrifices, but they will be better in the end. But those who turn from Fate, break their Oaths, & curse the gods meet tragic endings, even if they're happier in the short run. Heroism means rising to the challenges of Fate, even when the gods are pitted against you. It means losing yourself in the wilderness for decades, only to return in glory when your enemies think you long dead. It means betraying your loved ones, overthrowing rightful kings over petty grievances, & discovering you were a pawn of Prophecy all along. Heroes' lives aren't easy; they're dramatic. It's not their victories that make them memorable -- it's all their failures along the way.

## CLASS FEATURES

#### PROPHECY DOMAIN
Oracles pay special attention to dreams, intuitive thoughts, & hallucinatory visions; commonly believed capable of predicting future events, their visions are widely misinterpreted. They live by the phrase, "know thyself". Oracles often carry special varieties of incense & holy oil with them. The holy oil may be boiled to produce vapors, which the oracle inhales in order to enter a trance during which they thrash & wail to flashes of divine insight. They often employ scribes to write down their words, as they retain little memory of the experience.

###### Prophecy Domain Spells

3: Augery, Locate Object
5: Beacon of Hope, Clairvoyance

Additionally, when you cast a spell of 1st level or higher that restores HP, you may choose to add the effect of fog cloud at the location of 1 of your targets. You must complete a long rest before you can create another fog cloud with this feature.

Additionally, while you are in the trance, you gain darkvision out to a range of 60ft, & you can see invisible creatures & objectives within 10ft of you that are within line of sight.

#### CIRCLE OF SACRIFICE
_It was the Dragonlords who brought their foreign notions of good & evil to Thylea. Before their arrival, it was understood that the gods & Titans are not to be challenged; they are only to be honored & appeased. If lives must be sacrificed to calm their anger, then that is the ultimate good. Clinging to life is not only pathetic; it's an insult to the Mistress of Death, who has been charged with shepherding each soul at its appointed time. -Chondrus, Priest of Lutheria_
Druids of the Circle of Sacrifice believe that nature connects 1 to the entire universe, including the stars & the astral void between planes. They know that immutable laws have been set down by the great powers of the universe & that sacrifices must be made to these powers in order to keep the balance. Such sacrifices take the form of great bonfires, wherein fallen creatures are immolated. Druids who keep the Circle of Sacrifice are sometimes called the Keepers of the Old Ways, & they revere mistletoe as a sacred plant connected to the infinite power of the astral plane. Mistletoe must be harvested with extreme care, following rituals that ensure that the plant maintains its potency. As 1 of the keepers of the Old Ways, you sometimes gather with others of your kind at sacred rings of standing stones. These standing stones connect the natural world to the heavens & the astral void.

###### Ritual of Sacrifice
Starting at 2nd level, you learn how to perform a sacrificial ritual that pleases the gods. You know the produce flame cantrip. When you make an attack with produce flame, add your WIS to the Damage roll.
**Immolation**: Whenever you reduce a creature to zero hp, you may choose to immolate them as a sacrificial offering. As the creature is engulfed in fire, you & every ally within 60 feet of the immolated creature gain the effects of the bless spell for 1 minute (concentration is not required). You may use this feature a number of times equal to your WIS, & you regain all expended uses after a short or long rest.

###### Ritual of Mistletoe
Starting at 6th level, you carry a pouch full of mistletoe that you’ve collected with your sickle. You have sprigs of mistletoe represented by a number of d4s equal to your druid level. On your turn, you may use a bonus action to expend 1 of the sprigs of mistletoe & perform 1 of the following effects:  
- **Divining Ritual**: You cast detect magic without using a spell slot.  
- **Healing Ritual**: You cast cure wounds as a 1st-level spell without using a spell slot.  
- **Purification Ritual**: You cast purify food & drink without using a spell slot.  
- **Song of the Solstice**: You cast heroism as a 1st-level spell without using a spell slot.  
Additionally, any time you cast a spell that restores HP, you may expend any number of sprigs of mistletoe to roll those dice & add them to the number of HP restored. You regain all expended sprigs of mistletoe after completing a long rest.

###### Keeper of the Law
Starting at 10th level, you are initiated into an ancient order of druidic judges who keep & enforce the laws of the cosmos. Your sprigs of mistletoe increase to d6s.  
**Sacrificial Offering**: On your turn, you may use a bonus action to choose 1 creature that you can see. That creature is marked as a Sacrificial Offering for the next hour. Whenever any of your allies hit that creature with an attack, you may use a reaction to expend 1 of your sprigs of mistletoe to roll the die & add the result as Burn Damage. Additionally, whenever a Sacrificial Offering is reduced to zero HP, you may activate your Immolation feature on that creature.  
**Restoration Ritual**: On your turn, you may use an action to expend 2 sprigs of mistletoe to cast the lesser restoration spell.

###### Astrological Wisdom
Starting at 14th level, you have studied the stars & memorized the pathways that connect the material plane to the astral plane. Your sprigs of mistletoe increase to d8s. Additionally, you gain access to the teleportation circle spell & always have it prepared.  
**Stone Circle**: You know the ancient methods used to construct a circle of standing stones. You may spend 8 hours & 12,000gp to construct a circle of 12 standing stones inscribed with druidic sigils, where each stone is 10 feet tall & weighs 1 ton. This stone circle may be used as a permanent anchor location for the teleportation circle spell.

#### ACADEMY PHILOSOPHER
Academy philosophers are great thinkers who do not specialize in any particular spell school, but rather spend their time analyzing the nature of reality & applying that learning to their magic. They usually spend many years studying at venerable schools where philosophers from many different disciplines gather. They enjoy participating in endless debates & dialogues, & they always seek to score points on those who champion rival schools of thought.

###### Philosophical Schools
Starting at 2nd level, you choose from 1 of several philosophical schools to specialize in at your academy. This school becomes deeply ingrained in your way of thinking about the world.

**School: Cynicism**  
Cynics believe that 1 should reject material desires such as wealth & power. They advocate for an ascetic lifestyle, seeking to increase virtue by achieving harmony with nature. Starting when you choose this school at 2nd level, the gold & time you must spend to copy a spell into your spellbook is halved. Additionally, you may spend 10min foraging to locate the material components for any spell, with a total value of 50gp or less.  

**School: Eclecticism**  
Eclectics believe that no single set of doctrines can be all-encompassing. They adapt the ideas of multiple philosophical schools by choosing what they think is most reasonable. Starting when you choose this school at 2nd level, you learn an additional language of your choice. Starting at 5th level, choose another philosophical school. You gain the abilities of that school.  

**School: Empiricism**  
Empiricists believe that the world must be observed to be understood, & that the goal of philosophy is to understand why things are as they are. Starting when you choose this school at 2nd level, you become proficient in the Perception skill. Additionally, you may cast the identify or detect magic spell once with this trait (without using a spell slot), & you regain the ability to do so after completing a short or long rest.  

**School: Epicureanism**  
Epicureans believe that the world is ruled by chance & that appealing to the gods is useless vanity. They believe that happiness is achieved by minimizing pain & living simple lives. Starting when you choose this school at 2nd level, when a creature you can see attacks you, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on the attack roll. You may use this ability a number of times equal to your INT, & it recharges when you complete a short or long rest.  

**School: Stoicism**  
Stoics believe that we must develop self-control & fortitude in order to overcome our own self-destructive emotions. They advocate for humility & faith as antidotes to suffering. Starting when you choose this school at 2nd level, whenever you take Damage that reduces you to zer0 HP or less, you may spend a spell slot of 1st level or higher to be reduced to 1 HP instead. Once you have used this feature, you may not use it again until you complete a short or long rest.  

**School: Sophism**  
Sophists specialize in developing rhetorical & aesthetic powers, & they advocate for principles of excellence & virtue in all endeavors. Starting when you choose this school at 2nd level, you become proficient in the Persuasion skill & double your proficiency bonus when using that skill. Additionally, you gain the friends cantrip.  

**School: Hedonism**  
Hedonists believe that pleasure is the supreme good, & that everyone should seek to achieve the immediate gratification of their desires. Starting when you choose this school at 2nd level, when you regain HP from a spell or ability, you may choose to add twice your wizard level to the number of HP restored. Once you have used this feature, you may not use it again until you complete a short or long rest.  

**School: Skepticism**  
Skeptics believe that to truly possess knowledge of things is impossible. They believe that there are universal truths, but they cannot be understood well enough to shape dogmatic ideas about the world. Starting when you choose this school at 2nd level, you have advantage on ability checks to detect visual illusions & on Saves against effects imposed by them. You also have advantage on Saves against spells & effects that would charm you.

###### Metaphysical Principles
Starting at 6th level, you gain new insights into the nature of causality. Whenever a creature casts a spell with a single target that you can see, you can use your reaction to choose a new target for the spell. The new target must be legal for that spell. Once you have used this feature, you may not use it again until you complete a short or long rest.

###### Magical Paradox
Starting at 10th level, you’ve spent years studying philosophical paradoxes, which allows you to work seemingly impossible feats with magic. Whenever you would lose concentration on a spell for any reason, you may choose to maintain concentration instead, as long as you are not incapacitated. You may use this feature a number of times equal to your INT, & you regain any expended uses after a long rest.

## NEW SPELLS

###### Animal Polymorph
3rd-level transmutation  
Class: Druid, Ranger, Sorcerer
Casting Time: 1 action  
Range: 60 feet  
Components: V, S  
Duration: Concentration, up to 10min  
This spell transforms a creature you can see within range into a new beast form. An unwilling creature must make a WIS Save to avoid the effect. A shapechanger automatically succeeds on this Save. The transformation lasts for the duration, or until the target drops to zer0 HP or dies. The new form can be any beast of CR 1 or less that does not have a fly speed. While in this new form, the target is charmed by you & views you as a trusted ally. The target can understand simple commands such as “attack” or “stay.” The charm affects creatures that are immune to charm in their normal form. The charm ends immediately when the target reverts to its normal form. The target’s game statistics, including mental ability scores, are replaced by the statistics of the chosen beast. It retains its alignment & personality. The creature is limited in the actions it can perform by the nature of its new form, & it can’t speak, cast spells, or take any other action that requires hands or speech. The creature's gear melds into its new form. The creature can’t activate, use, wield, or otherwise benefit from any of its equipment. The target assumes the HP of its new form. When it reverts to its normal form, the creature returns to the number of HP it had before it transformed. If it reverts as a result of dropping to zer0 HP, any excess Damage carries over to its normal form.

###### Fatebinding
3rd-level necromancy  
Class: Cleric, Warlock, Wizard
Casting Time: 1 action  
Range: 30 feet  
Components: V  
Duration: 1 hour  
Choose 2 creatures that you can see. Both creatures must make CHA Saves, & they do so with advantage if they are hostile to you. If a creature is charmed by you, it has disadvantage on this Save. If both creatures fail their Saves, then their fates are now bound together. The 2 target creatures remain fate-bound for the duration of the spell, even if both targets are on different planes of existence. 
- Whenever 1 of the creatures takes Damage, the other creature takes an identical amount of Damage, unless both creatures took Damage from the same single source, such as a fireball spell.  
- Whenever 1 of the creatures regains HP, the other creature regains an identical number of HP, unless both creatures regained HP from the same single source, such as mass cure wounds.  

###### Sleeping Draught
2nd-level enchantment  
Class: Bard, Warlock, Wizard
Casting Time: 1 action  
Range: 20 feet  
Components: V, S, M (a draught of liquid)  
Duration: 1 minute  
You open a draught & a purple mist flows from you to a target creature. Roll 9d8; if the target creature has fewer current HP than the total, then it falls unconscious. The target remains unconscious until the spell ends, the sleeper takes Damage, or someone uses an action to shake or slap the sleeper awake. If the target creature has more HP than the rolled total, then it becomes drowsy & its speed is halved, it can’t take reactions, & it can’t make more than 1 melee or ranged attack during its turn. The target remains drowsy until it takes Damage or until the spell ends. Undead & creatures that are immune to being charmed aren’t affected by this spell.  
**Higher Levels**: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, roll an additional +3d8 for each slot level above the 2nd.
