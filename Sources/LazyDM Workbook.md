Quick Encounter Building
When building encounters, start by choosing the type and number of monsters that make sense for the situation.
Then use the following guidelines to compare the challenge rating of the monsters, the level of the characters, and the ratio of monsters to characters.
If the quantity of monsters or their challenge rating is beyond the indicated guidelines, the encounter might be deadly. Be especially careful with potentially deadly encounters when the characters are 1st level.

1st Level Characters
- CR zero to 1/4: 1 monster per character
- CR 1/2: 1 monster per 2 characters
- CR 1: 1 monster per 4 characters

2nd-4th Level Characters
- CR = 1/10 level: 2 monsters per character
- CR = 1/4 level: 1 monster per character
- CR = 1/2 level: 1 monster per 2 characters
- CR = Level: 1 monster per 4 characters

5th-20th Level Characters
- CR = 1/10 level: 4 monsters per character
- CR = 1/4 level: 2 monsters per character
- CR = 1/2 level: 1 monster per character
- CR = 3/4 level: 1 monster per 2 characters
- CR = Level+3: 1 monster per 4 characters

Finally, tune encounters by adjusting the number of monsters, increasing or decreasing hit points, or making named or unique monsters more powerful.

**Hit Points**: Standard monster hit points are an average of the monster’s HD range. You can increase or decrease hit points within that range to model particularly weak or particularly strong monsters.
To make a fight easier, you can also treat monsters as “instant minions,” ignoring their usual hit points and letting a single attack kill them. Having a few enemies die quickly can turn the tide in favor of the characters and keep a battle from feeling stale.

**Named Monsters**: Adding an extra attack or
maximizing damage can make a named monster or unique foe more challenging. Named monsters can also be given legendary actions or the Legendary Resistance feature to make the fight more interesting.

Running Large Numbers
**For Attacks**: Subtract the monsters’ attack modifier from the defender’s AC and consult the Result column.
Determine the number of monsters who hit by dividing the total number of monsters by the number indicated under Monsters per Single Success. If the monsters that hit have advantage, double their damage dealt. If they have more than one attack, multiply the damage by the number of attacks.

**For Saving Throws**: Subtract the monsters’ saving throw modifier from the effect’s saving throw DC, and consult the Result column. Determine the number of monsters that succeed on the saving throw by dividing the total number of monsters by the number indicated under Monsters per Single Success.

Result | Monsters per Single Success
-------|-
< 6    | 1
6-12   | 2
13-14  | 3
15-16  | 4
17-18  | 5
19     | 10
20+    | 20

**Pooling Hit Points**: When running a large number of monsters, consider pooling their hit points together.
Then subtract the damage dealt by characters to any of those monsters from the pool, instead of tracking damage to each monster independently.
Every time the pool takes damage equal to the hit point value of a monster, one monster dies. For example, in an encounter against twenty-five skeletons with 13hp each, the pool has a total of 325 hit points. If a fighter swings a greatsword and hits for 29 damage, the pool is reduced by 29 and two skeletons die.
Each time a monster dies because an effect automatically deals enough damage to kill it, its hit points are deducted from the pool. For example, if a sorcerer hits eight skeletons with a fireball spell (dealing a minimum of 14 fire damage on a successful save), each of the eight skeletons takes 13 damage and dies, and the pool is reduced by 104 hit points.

Lazy Lairs
The following pages contain the maps and descriptions
for ten lazy lairs—quick adventure setups based around
a number of commonly used fantasy-setting locations:
- Castle
- Docks
- Sewers
- Catacombs
- Caves
- Cellars
- Dungeon
- Mines
- Temple
- Wizard’s Tower

These lazy lairs are meant to help you improvise locations as they come up during your game.
None of the lairs have descriptions of potential inhabitants or other story elements. Instead, you’ll generate and place these features yourself, so that each lair can provide the foundation for your own unique adventure.
The text description of each lair includes italicized text. This text can either be read aloud or used to help you summarize the location.
Each room description begins with the area’s aspects. These aspects can give you potential hooks for character exploration or environmental effects. They also help to define the area, so you don’t need to read the description out loud if you don’t want to. Instead, you can summarize the location by improvising your own descriptions of these aspects.
Many of these locations have transition points that can connect to other lairs. The castle has drain grates that can lead to the sewers, and an escape tunnel leading into hidden caves. The caves feature a connection to the sewers and a door that can lead to any underground location, and an underground river that might flow out to the docks. The crypts and the dungeon could connect to the temple, which in turn could connect back to the castle. You might even connect all ten lazy lairs into a single huge adventure site if you like.
You can likewise modify these dungeons to fit the size and scale of the adventure you want to run. Cave-ins and bricked-up walls can take a fourteen-room lair and turn it into a three-room lair, focusing it to fit the size of your adventure. You can also add in your own fantastic features to make any lair area unique.
As with everything else in this workbook, you should feel free to make changes to the lairs to suit your needs and the needs of your game.

CASTLE
Gray stone walls protect the central keep of this fortress as they have for hundreds of years. Four sturdy towers and high walkways offer a clear view for miles around. Raised portcullises stand above the long stone entryway to the central courtyard.

25. **Toilet**: Area Aspects: Foul stench of waste, cesspit below. The stench of waste wafts up from the thirty-foot-deep pit beneath this toilet.
26. **Torture Chamber**: Area Aspects: Torture rack, torture tables, drain to chamber below. Thick leather straps hang from two large tables that are both scarred and stained.

SEWERS
The smell of the foulest refuse of humanity wafts thickly through these slick tunnels, whose construction marks them as hundreds of years old. The sound of skittering claws on stone interrupts the continual dripping of liquid into the deep pools that fill these chambers. The map of the sewers contains a number of crank wheels, sluices, and doors that can be open or shut to seal off or flood various parts of the complex. You should decide what these controls do in the sewers (if anything) before the characters start to work them. For example, sealing off certain flanges that control the flow of sewage or water might cause that flow to back up and flood the lower chambers.
