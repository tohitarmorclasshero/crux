Demonology  
Level: 1  
Range: 20'  
Duration: Varies  
Temple(s): All  
Description: This spell summons a creature from the planes beyond. These are not always nice, well-behaved demon servitors of the deities; these are the screaming, mad beings from the Planes Beyond. Because the skin between the worlds is very thin, it is quite easy to tear a hole to pull something through. Even the lowliest sorcerer can do it, though whether they can control what they get is uncertain. The steps to cast this spell are as follows:  
1. The caster chooses the power of the entity they wish to summon. Casters are limited to twice their Casting Level in Hit Dice. This maximum can be modified by Symbols of Power and sacrifices. If the caster wishes to call one of the demon servitors of their deity, this should be stated here.  
2. The caster makes a PSY saving throw. If they fail, a more powerful being than desired might come through, with no association with their deity.  
3. The GM will determine the form and powers of the entity pulled through.  
4. The caster and the demon roll for domination to see which one will be in control. Each rolls a d20, modified by their CastLv or HD, Symbols of Power, and sacrifices. If summoning allies of the caster’s deity, the caster gets a +5 to their roll.  
Symbols of Power are magical diagrams used to focus the magical energy and give the caster greater control over the summoning. They require 500 gold pieces of materials for every +1 bonus to the HD of the demon and to the Domination roll. Each 2 Hit Dice of creatures sacrificed gives the caster a +1 on the Domination roll and the HD of the demon, or 1 hit die for a +1 bonus, if the sacrifice is of the same race as the caster. To count as a sacrifice, the victims must be helpless at the time of the slaying and purposefully slain just for this purpose. Combat deaths do not count as sacrifices. Some demons accept other sacrifices, such as money, gems, magic items, or spells. The details of these negotiations are left up to the characters and the demons to determine. The summoned demon will remain an amount of time determined by the Domination roll. For further information, see the Demonology chapter.

Etherealization, Insubstantiality, or Guiding, or Ascertainment of Thoughts can find the victim. If the target uses Insubstantiality, Exhumation, or Transportation, they can escape. Digging also works, though 6 feet of stone will take a long time. Disenchantment does not work on this spell.

Additionally, there is a 2% chance per spell level that this spell will falter as a result of the spell casting, and the spellcaster’s astral form will return to the physical body. If the caster’s physical body is moved more than 100 miles from its original location while the astral form is away, the link is sundered and the caster’s soul becomes lost on the astral plane.

Temple(s): All  
Description: This spell puts a curse on an object that is triggered under a condition specified by the caster, detonating for 2d6 points of damage in a 5ft radius. If the condition requires someone to touch or read the cursed object, they suffer full damage, no save allowed. Anyone else in the spell area that succeeds at a PSY saving throw takes half damage. The object on which the curse was cast is obliterated, unless it is unaffected by fire. Another creature can remove the curse with a successful casting of the Disenchantment spell. If the object is moved without triggering the condition, the spell dissipates. The Detect Traps talent will not detect this spell, but the Ascertainment of Foes, Discerner of Enchantments, and Perception of the Energies spells will. Any condition may be set, as long as it has some immediate relation to the trapped object. For instance, a cursed object cannot be set to explode when the King of a far-away city sneezed, but it could be set to explode when some-one in the same room with the object sneezed. There may be only one triggering situation per spell, though an object may have more than one Execration spell cast on it.

Description: The target of this spell can find the shortest, most direct physical route to a specified destination, whether into or out of a locale. The locale can be outdoors, underground, or even inside a Labyrinth of Elongated Shadows spell. This spell works with respect to locations, not objects or creatures at a locale. The spell enables the subject to sense the correct direction that will eventually lead it to its destination, indicating at appropriate times, the exact path to follow or physical actions to take. The target cannot be confused by secret doors, hidden paths, or other physical means of deception. Magical deceits such as interplanar gates, teleportation, or magical barriers, will fool this spell. The spell ends when the destination is reached, or the duration expires, whichever comes first. This spell can be used to remove the subject and its companions from the effect of a Labyrinth of Elongated Shadows spell in a single round. This spell is immune to Disenchantment. Misguiding, the reverse of this spell, renders a touched being completely incapable of finding its way alone.

It may also be detected by a Discerner of Enchantments spell cast on the victim.

Wall Combat  
When Wall spells meet, several outcomes are possible:  
1. They can ‘fight’ each other until one dissipates and the other wall continues.  
2. One wall can ‘destroy’ another wall without combat.  
3. The walls can ‘block’ each other until one dissipates.  
4. The walls may ‘pass’ through each other unaffected.  
The behavior of walls when they meet is detailed in the Wall vs. Wall Table, below.  

Fight = F
Block = B
Destroy = D
Pass = P

**Fight**
Each wall starts with 2d6 HP. An attack roll of 15 or better is needed for one wall to hit the other. A hit causes 1d6 damage. When one wall reaches zero HP, it vanishes, and the other wall may proceed to move. Any damage caused by an ‘injured’ wall is proportional to the amount of remaining HP (for example, if 5 HP remain out of a total of 10, the wall does half damage). Wall combat takes place as if the wall was a member of the party, with the Initiative of the party.
