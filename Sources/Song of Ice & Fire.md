Rewards & Improvement

Coin
Coin is the most tangible reward of the three. Acquiring coin improves your purchasing power, allowing you to upgrade weapons and armor, acquire new steeds, and so on. Alternatively, you can invest Coin into your house to outfit your soldiers, fund land improvements, expand your keep, and more. Coin rewards come from prizes and victories, mostly, but may also arise as payments, ransoms, and favorable business transactions.

Spending Coin
You may spend Coin on any equipment or service described in Chapter 7: Equipment. For house and land improvements that require Coin, see Chapter 6: House & Lands.

Glory
Glory is the currency of the noble and is used to directly improve your family’s fortunes. Whenever you acquire Glory as a reward, you may invest that Glory into your family’s house by returning to your lands. You simply transfer the Glory to your house, dividing it up or investing it all in one or more of your house’s resources. The effect of accumulated Glory is far less immediate and may take time to realize its benefits.

Spending Glory
For details on Glory and its uses, see Chapter 6: House & Lands.

Experience
Coin’s benefits are obvious and tend to have short-lived returns. Glory always affects your house, slowly improving your family’s fortunes.
Experience, however, marks your personal improvement, providing a means to gradually increase your abilities, improve or acquire new specialties, and accumulate Destiny Points. Thus, of the three rewards, Experience has the greatest impact on your character.

Spending Experience
Experience improves your character, allowing you an avenue for increasing your ranks, specialty dice, and Destiny Points. The cost of such improvement varies, based on what areas you want to address. Specialties are the least expensive, while Destiny Points are the most expensive. You may spend earned Experience at any time.

Acquire or Improve Specialty (10xp)
You can acquire a new specialty at 1B or improve an existing specialty by +1B. If you’re improving a specialty, the specialty dice cannot exceed your rank in the governing ability. Therefore, if you have Fighting 3 (Axes 2B, Long Blades 3B), you could improve Axes to 3B, but you couldn’t improve Long Blades until your Fighting is at least 4.

Improve Ability (30xp)
You can spend Experience to improve an ability. It costs 30xp to raise an ability by 1 rank, and 30 Experience for each additional rank. So to improve Fighting 2 to Fighting 3, you would spend 30xp. To improve Fighting 2 to Fighting 4, you would spend 60xp.
Improving an ability takes time and training. For every rank you would increase your ability, you must spend 1 week training under the tutelage of a character who has at least 1 rank higher than you in the ability you want to improve. You can still improve the ability without the trainer, but the time increases to 1+1d6/2 weeks.

Gain A Benefit (50xp)
You gain a Benefit of your choice for which you meet the requirements.

Erase A Drawback (50xp)
You can erase a drawback of your choice.
