## BACKGROUNDS

Background also provides a slight mechanical edge, such as a bonus to a skill, fluency in an extra language, or an extra skill to your list of class skills. Some backgrounds grant other benefits, such as the regional benefits described in the Forgotten Realms Players Guide.
Many backgrounds include suggested skills, suggested languages, optional background benefits, or all of the above. Choose 1 of the following benefits from those listed:
- Add 1 of the suggested skills to your list of class skills.
- Gain a +2 bonus to checks made using 1 of the suggested skills.
- Gain fluency in 1 of the suggested languages.
- Gain the optional background benefit.

###### Accursed Lineage
Whispers about your family’s lineage haunted your childhood. Claims of being cursed, doomed, or otherwise touched by evil made your early years difficult. These troubles sourced from tales about your family’s history because it is believed you are a descendant of the infamous Acererak.  
**Possible Minor Quests**: You might seek to clear your family’s name, uncover the truth about your family’s past, or follow in the steps of your dark ancestor. 
**Suggested Skills**: History, Intimidate, Religion 
**Background Benefit**: You gain a +2 bonus to Diplomacy & Intimidate checks when interacting with undead creatures.

###### Adventurer’s Scion
One or both of your parents were adventurers & you grew up listening to stories about their achievements, the monsters they defeated, & the fantastic places they explored. Although each tale was more harrowing than the last, they always came out victorious in the end, with 1 exception: the Tomb of Horrors. They never speak of it, except to say it was an evil place -- dark like no other. The only survivors, they left many friends in that accursed dungeon & warned you against following in their steps.  
**Possible Minor Quests**: You might seek out the fabled Tomb of Horrors to succeed where your parent or parents failed. You could search the dungeons or what lies beyond to rescue their lost comrades.  
**Suggested Skills**: Arcana, History, Religion  
**Background Benefit**: +Adv on monster knowledge checks.

###### Curious Archeologist
Dungeons, ruins, & old tombs house the secrets of the past, & dedicated scrutiny can reveal much of old civilizations & famous personages. So whenever an opportunity arises to examine a historical sight, you’re loath to let it pass you by. While many dungeons capture your imagination, none of them has quite the same allure as does the Tomb of Horrors.  
**Possible Minor Quests**: You might explore the corridors of Acererak’s tomb, retrieve relics from the deep chambers, or seek lore about who Acererak was in life.  
**Suggested Skills**: History, Perception, Thievery  
**Background Benefit**: When engaging in a skill challenge to disable a trap, your first successful Thievery check grants you an extra success.

###### Lost Kin
When you were young, your favorite relative -- parent, sibling, or other family -- left in search of glory, treasure, & adventure. From time to time, you received trinkets & letters recounting their successes & near-failures, but eventually the letters stopped coming. The last letter was brief, saying only they were headed for Skull City somewhere in the Vast Swamp. After years of no communication, your family believed the relative met an ill end somewhere in that sinister place, but no 1 knows & the question of what really happened haunts you still.  
**Possible Minor Quests**: Although searching for your lost kin might be the forefront of your concerns, you should be careful of what you seek. In all likelihood, your lost kin might be searching for you, but this person might not be the person you remember. You relative might have been driven mad, might seek to give you a cursed relic pulled from the dungeons she explored, or might even return as an undead monster. In any event, putting the memory of your relative to rest, & perhaps the relative herself, might serve as a suitable minor quest.  
**Suggested Skills**: Any class skill  
**Suggested Language**: Any language other than Abyssal or Supernal  
**Background Benefit**: You gain a +3 bonus to Nature checks made to recall useful information about geography.

###### Necromancer’s Chattel
The Bleak Academy keeps a stable of living slaves to murder & animate as undead when they come of age. Life in servitude to these necromancers is understandably bleak. But you escaped your chains & survived the long flight through the Vast Swamp to reach civilized lands. Do you want vengeance? Will you fight to liberate the others held by the necromantic cabal?
**Possible Minor Quests**: You might have escaped, but your former captors are not likely to let you stay free. You might have to avoid their attempts to reclaim you, so you are always moving & staying 1 step ahead of them. Or you might go back, intent on freeing your fellows & razing the necromancers’ city.  
**Suggested Skills**: Endurance, Religion, Stealth  
**Background Benefit**: You gain a +2 racial bonus to saving throws to end conditions & ongoing effects with the fear keyword.

###### Restless Dead
Undead horrors stalk the countryside in your homeland, preying on the living & staining the land with their evil presence. You grew up fighting these monsters, watching as your friends & kin fell at your side only to rise as zombies or worse. You escaped the nightmare of youth, but the experiences fill your nights with nightmares. Have you sworn to fight undead no matter the cost? Or are they so terrible that you cannot bear to face them?  
**Possible Minor Quests**: Finding & destroying the origin of the undead creatures menacing your community might drive you to undertake a life of adventure. You might scour the countryside to find & destroy powerful agents until you find the true source of the burgeoning evil.  
**Suggested Skills**: Insight, Perception, Religion  
**Background Benefit**: You gain a +1 bonus to damage rolls against creatures with the undead keyword.

###### Touched by Darkness
You might have served a necromancer in your youth, perhaps as an apprentice or possibly as guard or servant. Proximity to your master’s corruption left a mark on you. Did your experience alter how you see undead? Is necromancy a path you might seek or is it an abomination to be fought & destroyed? How does the mark manifest on you? Are you pale? Do you suffer from a disfiguring condition, or are you unhinged?  
**Possible Minor Quests**: You might have born witness to appalling acts of wickedness, & if so, you might seek redemption, fighting the darkness to atone for your past. You might also seek out the necromancer or undead master you served to prevent his works from plunging the world into death.  
**Suggested Skills**: Intimidate, Stealth, Religion  
**Background Benefit**: You gain a +1 bonus to saving throws against ongoing effects & conditions with the necrotic keyword.

###### Sarifal
**Regional Benefit**: You gain Terrain Walk in 1 of the following environments, allowing you to bypass difficult terrain: Earth, Forest, Ice, or Swamp (see: Monster Manual 283).

###### Sarifal Lore
**History DC10**: Settled centuries ago by peat harvesters & fishermen, scores of cantrevs -- small communities governed by a heda -- dot the wilderness. They've long given up on establishing any kind of central authority, leaving larger matters to be resolved by mutual gifting & political marriages, smoothed over by the druids who protect their traditions & culture. 
**History DC15**: Divine powers have long sought a foothold on the Moonshae Isles, sending missionaries & priests to convert the folk to their faith. This has not been an easy task, for the folk regard only the spirit of the land as the guiding force in their daily lives. Even benevolent Chauntea has sought to usurp the worship of the folk, by claiming this spirit is nothing more than an aspect of her greater divinity. The druids of the region know the truth of her nature, however, & work tirelessly to preserve their traditional culture.  
**Religion DC20**: The means through which the spirit of the land sends her power to the world, & through which her druids perceive her needs are the moonwells. These precious pools of clear water are located throughout most of the isles, & offer beneficial properties known to the druids alone. 

+++++

Older Backgrounds from Dragon366

#A

###### Apprentice to a Sinister Cabal
(Dragon366)
To call your fellow conspirators a “cult” is to credit them with more fervor & less intelligence than they’ve earned. You are part of a secret group that wields arcane power for a mysterious purpose -- and there might be secrets within the cabal that you don’t know about yet. How were you recruited into this cabal, & what is their professed aim? Do you have mentors, friends, or rivals in the cabal? Are you still an active member, or have you left the cabal temporarily or permanently?  
**Proficiency**: Arcana & Dungeoneering.

###### Assassin
(Dragon366)
You’ve been trained in the thousand arts of death, sent to preemptively kill the powerful. What secret order taught you your trade, & how did they recruit you? What targets have you assassinated, & did any escape your clutches? Do you have a current contract, did you give up the assassin’s life, or are you on the run?  
**Proficiency**: Stealth, +Adv to checks when escaping the scene of a crime.

#B

###### Black Warden
(Dragon366)
You regard yourself as part of the natural world -- but you’re the part of the natural world that nurtures and protects the rest. You strive against dangers both mundane (like a negligent charcoal-burner) & magical (a mysterious taint that kills vegetation by night). Why are you now an adventurer rather than still in your forest? How do you react when you’re taken far from the natural world, like the heart of a city? Is there a particular enemy of the forest you hold a grudge against?  
**Proficiency**: Nature & Persuade, +Adv to Persuade when exercising your authority.

###### Brother in Battle
(Dragon366)
Not everyone needs to be chased across the world by black-cloaked assassins. You crave fighting, beer-drinking, & companionship -- friendly or amorous. Have you always had such simple desires, or did you come to this simplicity after years spent striving for something more esoteric? Are there particular enemies you relish fighting -- or particular brands of ale you savor?  
**Proficiency**: Endurance checks.

#C

###### Cat Burglar
(Dragon366)
You take an artisan’s approach to large-scale burglary, stealing from the most well-protected treasure troves you can find. What particularly notable items have you stolen, & what did you do with the proceeds? Did you work alone or as part of a gang? If you worked with others, what do they think of you now? Did you ever get caught?  
**Proficiency**: Athletics, climbing kit.

###### Child of Prophecy
(Dragon366)
The prophetic words were written in scripture long before you were born, & you’re part of a concentrated effort to fulfill, safeguard, or thwart that prophecy. What is the nature of the prophecy, and what’s your relationship to it? Do you question whether your fate is truly ordained? Who or what is standing in your way?  
**Proficiency**: Once per Long Rest, gain +Adv on an Initiative.

###### Cloistered Priest
(Dragon366)
You’ve grown up in the heart of religious worship, & know the rituals & rites of your faith better than most. What event sent you out into the wider world? Under what circumstances will you return? Given your sheltered upbringing, how do you react to the strange & the dangerous?  
**Proficiency**: Religion, +Adv when invoking religious rites.

###### Con-Artist
(Dragon366)
You’ve long made a living on the backs of the gullible & foolish. What sort of confidence games did you favor -- elaborate conspiracies, rigged games of chance, or ruses that facilitated traditional crimes like burglary, robbery, or kidnapping? How did you learn your trade? How close have you come to getting caught? How many enemies are out there, looking for a chance to get even?  
**Proficiency**: Persuade, +Adv when running a known confidence ploy.

###### Crusading Zealot
(Dragon366)
Your calling is an intensely personal one. The voices of the gods themselves sent you on your crusade, & they guide you to this day. How do others react when you tell them what drives you forward? What was it like, the first time you received divine inspiration? Do you ever doubt or question the voices?
**Proficiency**: +Adv on saves until you fail 1, then the bonus is lost until you complete a Long Rest.

###### Cult Escapee
(Dragon366)
At first, the group appeared to be on to something big, and you wanted to be a part of it. But when you saw how dark their grand design was, you ran. What drew you to the cult in the first place, & what caused you to spurn it? Who was in the cult: your friends, your family, your whole community? Are they hunting you still?  
**Proficiency**: Arcana, +Adv to Persuade when concealing true intentions.

#D

###### Detective
(Dragon366)
You have a justifiable pride in your powers of observation & deduction, & you take delight in surprising others with your conclusions that borders on the theatrical. How did you hone this inquisitive nature? With the city watch, in a noble court, or among the priesthood? Are there particularly notable crimes you’ve solved? Did your efforts earn you any lifetime friends or enemies?  
**Proficiency**: Investigate, +Adv when surveying a crime scene. 

#E

###### Explorer-Guide
(Dragon366)
Ever since you saw your first map, you wanted to know what the lands beyond the margin looked like. You're an inveterate traveler & guide. What places have you seen on your journeys?

**Proficiency**: 1 extra language of your choice, +Adv to Navigate checks when blazing a new trail.

#F

###### Former Gladiator
(Dragon366)
You’ve grown up fighting for the amusement of the crowd. Did you seek out this life, or was it thrust upon you? What sorts of gladiatorial spectacles did you take part in: individual combats, staged mass battles, gladiator-vs.-monster fights, or inherently unfair gladiator punishments (like unarmed prisoners against beasts)? And what kept you going? The whips of your masters, the lure of competition, or the roar of the crowd?  
**Proficiency**: Persuade, +Adv when performing acts of dazzling martial skill.

###### Fugitive From a Vengeful Rival
(Dragon366)
You’ve enraged someone powerful enough to make you a fugitive. Every month brings new evidence that your rival’s wrath hasn’t waned: a bounty hunter, trouble with the authorities, or posters indicated yet another increase in the price on your head. What caused you to take flight? How long have you been on the run, & what lands have you traveled through on the way? Is there something other than your death that will end the chase? Are you trying to escape, or will you ultimately turn the tables on your rival?  
**Proficiency**: Stealth, +Adv when evading detection.

#G

###### Gritty Sergeant
(Dragon366)
You’ve led people into battle; you can still feel their hot blood on your hands. Some of them lived to fight again. You’ve seen them come & go, some so quick you scarcely remember their names, if not their faces. Do you remember well -- or curse? Particular generals who wasted the lives of the those in your care? How fairs the transition to civilian life? Ever get caught giving orders just like the old days, or are you glad to have that responsibility lifted from your shoulders?  
**Proficiency**: Tactics, +Adv when commanding soldiers.

#H

###### Haunted Veteran
(Dragon366)
You saw things in the war that no 1 should have to see, & the horrors of war changed your personality. What were you like before you went to war?

**Proficiency**: +Adv on fear saves once per Short Rest.

#L

###### Last of the Breed
(Dragon366)
