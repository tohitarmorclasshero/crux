Knife Theory
Knife theory was originally posted on [reddit] by /u/jimbaby, and ported to [GMB] by /u/iveld. Check these versions for more information, the following is an abridged version:

Whats a Knife
When writing a character's back story, it's important to include a certain number of "knives". Knives are essentially anything that the DM can use to raise the stakes of a situation for your character. Anything that can make a conflict personal, like a threatened loved one or the appearance of a sudden enemy. They're called "knives" because the players lovingly forge them and present them to the DM so that the DM can use them to stab the player over and over again.

A Good Knife Block
When building a back story, your players should give you 7 - 12 knives. Here are some ideas, and here is a [table](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OwB16vUj51KXVfgHEqKRjFUSn9pzeWy1/view):

- A named person your character cares about, living or dead (e.g. sibling, spouse, childhood friend)
- A phobia or trauma your character has experienced
- A mystery in your character's life (e.g. unknown parents, unexplained powers)
- An enemy your character has
- Any ongoing obligation or loyalty your character has
- An obligation your character has failed
- A serious crime your character has committed
- A crime your character is falsely accused of
- Any discrimination experienced (e.g. fantasy racism)
- A favored item/heirloom
- A secret your character is keeping 

There should be variety in the type of knife. All of your knives shouldn't be family members, nor should they be crimes that you've done in the past. Each knife should consist of no more than two well worded sentences. 

One application of "be a fan of the main characters" applies when players "fight". One very common dnd horror story is the kender rogue stealing from the rest of the party. 

PvP
Party spats can be done well- confict between characters is rich with roleplay opportunities. My suggestion here is to reorient the motivations of the players of the characters who are in conflict, not disallow pvp altogether. 

Skill checks and Attack Rolls
- Attacks miss if the attacked player chooses it to
- Players choose the DC for social checks instead of doing Deception vs. Insight contests

Rewards
If the players feel the other has been a good sport, they can award the other with inspiration. See [Character goals Variant Rules] and [History points (Hx)]
Of course, if your players are good sport, and like the idea of not being able to metagame and being withheld information as a player as well as a character, by all means, go ahead. However, I think there would be much fewer negative interactions at the table if you implemented these rules. 

Rumors
Be a fan of characters other than your own. Alongside your background tables, you also want to create 2 rumors about your character that *other* people know -- 1 good, 1 bad, 1 false. You know which ones are which, but others may not.

Storytime
Invest in characters' arcs by giving a chance to roleplay, perhaps via "flashback" by playing an actual storygame ([Once upon a time](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/1234/once-upon-time-storytelling-card-game), [Burning Wheel](https://www.burningwheel.com/)). Here's a simple version:

Make Camp
When you make camp for the night give an opportunity for players to share stories: Lore from their culture, (that they make up), information about their backstories, etc. Telling the story invigorates the character and they gain their 1d4 x their level in temporary hit points. This can be used in conjunction with [Your Character Sheet Natters](#p6).

Remember that time
Any time before a roll, you can turn to a fellow party member and say something along the lines of "remember that time when..." and recount a story of when something similar happened with both party members present. Can be used in conjunction with [Hx](#p7).

How it Helps
This is a principle that applies to both GM's and players, and it's pretty self-explanatory. It's something that some people already do, but some don't, and some don't get it, so having it as a codified concept in your game could be really good. It generally just clarifies the relationship between the GM and the players, and helps prevent situations like the rogue dicking people over because "it's what my character would do", because when you're a fan of the main characters, it doesn't matter if your rogue would dick everyone over, because it doesn't make a good story, and it screws everyone unnecessarily.

Alternatives to Death
Your character might become unplayable for a variety of different reasons. When life is cheap - there are other ways you retire your character.

Choose your poison
While death does increase the stakes -- choosing the manner in which a character leaves the game is potent for the story. Here's a mechanic adapted from Apocalypse World 2nd Edition by D. Vincent Baker and Meguey Baker.
Note that in dnd there are really two deaths - going down (going to zero hit points) after which most of the control is arrested from your character and your life is in other's hands, typically in the climax of battle - and actual death, after which is the process of reviving the soul through magical means.

When life becomes untenable
When the character's health goes to zero you have the choice to push yourself. Instead of falling unconscious and making saves you continue on for a minute before dying. You still die when you reach negative HP equal to your hit point maximum.
If you did not push yourself, the experience has harrowed you so much that something must change:
- Your alignment changes
- 1 of your bonds, ideals or virtues changes
- You can no longer take any more levels in your current class
- Resolve 1 of you Bonds or Flaws, and pick another

Keep Moving
You're down but not out, you gain the frightened condition in regards to what brought you low. Keep crawling; you can't take any action except for move, and even then you're probe and can't get up.

Give Me A Gun
If you're going out, you're going out blazing. Get a friend to prop you up against something. You can't make moves or bonus actions, but you can make attacks with ranged weapons.

Resurrection
Resurrection is fairly limited -- requiring a DC15 spellcasting ability check by the caster which increases by +1 per level of the target. For the longer resurrection rituals, up to 3 other party members can attempt to aid the ritual, typically using a skill such as Arcana or Religion. The party member describes their contribution to the ritual, and rolls an appropriate skill check, with the DC decided by the DM based on their contribution. For each successful contribution, the DC of the resurrection reduces by 2. Upon being resurrected, you return to life with 1HP, and 3 levels of exhaustion.

Use the Whole Character Sheet
You have 10 points that you can split among your background aspects: Traits, Ideals, Bonds, and Flaws (max 5 in any). While you may have more parts of your character that matter to you, these are the only ones that gain mechanical significance. When you roll a d20, you can evoke one of these elements and gain a bonus to your roll for each point in it. Additionally, each time you evoke one of these aspects, you add a tick towards another aspect, and remove a tick beside this aspect. Later when you evoke an aspect with at tick, its treated as having additional points equal to the number of tics. You can only evoke any background aspect once per game session.
Circle the aspect that you deem most vital towards your character's self-worth, copy it on a piece of paper and give it to your GM. Your GM will track this aspect and in certain situations will ask you to roll a check of DC 5 (minor transgression), 10 (accidental transgression you regret afterwards), or 15 (significant transgression) when you behave counter towards this aspect. Your character leaves the party for a while if you accrue transgressions greater than your total Bonds.

Class Specific
In addition, if you're a Warlock, Cleric, Paladin, you are given another aspect that your GM keeps track of, although separately from your background aspect, unless they are sufficiently similar. If you're a Warlock, you don't know what this aspect is, but you're told whenever you break it.
If you're a beastmaster type class with a pet or animal companion (but not a familiar), add an aspect that involves the safety of that pet. The repercussions of this are large; You lose any class feature to conjure another pet or revive a dead one. Now if your pet dies and cannot be revived (same resurrection rules as you), then you also leave the party for a while. Increase the AC of the pet by 2, and the health by 1.5x.

Relationship Mechanics
Codifying how well you know other characters and in what setting. Useful as an internal guideline for how you should make decisions regarding other characters, as well as brainstorming interactions for starting parties.

Implementation
Basically, this is a way of mechanizing characters knowing each other, and a way of making sure that players build relationships between their characters without it being this big pulling-teeth type experience to get players to think out how their characters know each other, what they feel about each other, how they're connected, etc. Hx also is a fluid thing. As you get to know someone better or worse, Hx fluctuates. Basically for DnD you could just have this happen through roleplay, or you could come up with some way of mechanizing it yourself. Either one works. Relationship mechanics are standard in most PbtA games, but the example  here is from Apocalypse World 2nd Edition by D. Vincent Baker and Meguey Baker.

Creating Hx
Every player's character has Hx, history, with every other player's character. Your Hx with someone else says how well you know them. It's based on specific moments or episodes in your shared past. Your Hx with them, written on your character sheet, says how well you know them; theirs with you on their sheet, says how well they know you. It doesn't say how long you've known them, how much you like them, how positive your history together has been, or anything else necessarily, just how well you *"get"* them. If your Hx with somebody is negative, that means you really don't know them or can't predict what they'll do. Thus you can't effectively help them OR screw them over. Hx is asymmetrical -- my character might know yours Hx+2, but yours might know mine Hx-1.
Go around in a circle and set Hx, while the DM oversees and gives everyone their turn. On a players turn, they read some or all of the options under their background and ask the other players for volunteers. If any one of the payers never volunteered for any of the options, they use the default Hx listed under the background.
It's up to each player to choose which questions they'll ask on their turn, and up to all the other players to volunteer the answers. As DM, pay attention as the character's Hx are developing, this is great stuff, and jump in with questions and contributions of your own. 
Hx is used as a modifier for d20 checks for player-player interactions. For example you can roll a Hx check to "retroactively" determine if 2 players have a secret signal, or if you can non-verabally communicate a plan. 

Help Action
It's also the bonus each of you uses when you're helping each other on a roll. You each just have to roll higher than 10 to apply your total combined Hx bonus.
