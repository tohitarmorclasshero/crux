# Beowulf

###### Longhouse
Cast all across this wide land, like playing pieces flung across a carpet are longhouses, the centers of civic life; the homes of village hedas where their family & guests communally live, & most importantly display their wealth & prestige.
Almost any human settlement of note will be centered around a longhouse, where the community gathers. Longhouses range widely in size & luxury, & the measure of a longhouse reflects strongly on both the community & its leader.
The longhouse at the heart of a community is intrinsically tied to their way of life: a settlement without a longhouse of some kind is a sign that it lacks fellowship, & therefore it's little more than a series of families with scant sense of community or fraternity.
At the front of the longhouse is a large shaded deck or porch where the community is welcome to lounge, eat, & socialize.
Behind the longhouse, in a separate building connected via walking  large central hearth is used for cooking & heating. Around it are arrayed benches, where the members of the household & community lounge sit to eat & socialize. At 1 end, or perhaps in the center of 1 side of the oval of benches, is a raised area where the head of the house sits on their treasure seat. There is plenty of room to circulate & talk.
A longhouse is home to professional storytellers -- scops -- who tell the gathered people entertaining & instructional tales, like the poem Beowulf. Feast days are observed in the hall, as well as community meetings, ring-giving, & judicial gatherings.
People beyond the grangran & her immediate family may well sleep in the longhouse on a regular basis. Travelers, merchants, oathbound warriors, important crafters, & others may well bed down in the hall rather than building homes of their own.
Scattered around a longhouse might well be found groups of buildings dedicated to its service -- crafters homes & workshops, food stores, wood sheds, & fish huts. They are most often rectangular with pitched roofs, though the more ancient style of roundhouse is also still in use.
In contrast to longhouses, other lesser buildings tend to be quite simple in construction, with wooden frames & wattle & daub or plank walls under a thatched or shingled roof. 
Indeed, they are not built to last -- in history we see Anglo-Saxon settlements slowly moving across the countryside as timber buildings are built anew, rather than old ones repaired. 
Wood & space tend to be in plentiful supply, in a sparsely populated landscape. Settlements tend not to be fortified with walls or palisades: a heath-guard & a sturdy hall door is a more-trusted defense.
That “a door” is considered an important defensible feature speaks to the scale of warfare in the Age of Heroes. Most “battles” in this era are what we might consider small-scale skirmishes, with a few dozen warriors on each side. This is a significant feature of the time -- 100 warriors is a large warband, & a ship or 2 of warriors can accomplish world-changing deeds. The lands around the Whale Road are not heavily populated, there is no notion of “countries”, & rulers control small kingdoms, rather than large nations.
A longhouse is traditionally raised by a township at the request & financed by a heda -- a sort of baron or chieftain, Hero, or great commander -- or possibly 1 of their ancestors. What they call themselves is often up to them, & traditions vary. Whatever they are titled, the ruler of a settlement is intrinsically tied to the building & the health of their people. Being a hall-builder is an important mark of status, & shows a significant generosity to the community.
Similarly, it is very important that a ruler win the affection & loyalty of their people by the giving of gifts, & the ruler of a longhouse is the arbiter of who gets what. This might be a benevolent & kindly rule, enacted with the best interests of the community at heart. A good ruler may simply organize & steer a gracious community. Or it might be a tyrannical reign, where favorites are gifted wealth & privilege, & rule is maintained by the bullying & starving of those out of favor. Most fall somewhere in between.
Like in all things, human storytellers have many poetic & euphemistic terms for a ruler. & their words for ruler tell us a lot about the way they are viewed.
Chief among them is “ring giver”. The giving of rings -- arm rings, neck rings, finger rings, ringmail, or indeed any kind of treasure or war gear -- falls to the heda of a settlement, & this giving is highly symbolic of the bonds that hold life around the Whale Road together. The throne is similarly referred to as the "treasure seat", indicating the function of the ruler as a custodian & arbiter of wealth.
And so we have the strong impression that a ruler is 1 who gives gifts, & those onto whom they bestow their generosity give loyalty & service in return. It is openly a 2-way street:
A good heda is generous, wise & honest, & as a direct result their people are loyal, happy & healthy, & well looked-after. A bad heda is selfish, vainglorious, foolish & a liar, & as a direct result their people are melancholy & sickly. Indeed the term "poorly" -- meaning ill -- could be seen as related to this phenomenon.
If a longhouse or community has problems, it is responsibility of the 1 who claims the treasure seat to mend those hurts. Failure often results in their ultimate undoing.
Around the Whale Road, inheritance of power along family lines is never a given. While daughters may well be best placed to acquire the leadership of a settlement, it is the tradition that settlements & tribes vote for their representative. If a rival is able to win the right support by gift-giving, display of feats, or simply by brute force, they may take a throne. If this is done with the support of the community, then it isn't considered ill-won.
This giving of gifts in return for loyalty is a core value, & a great many customs & expectations spring from it. One's word-as-bond, death before dishonor, the idea that outliving one's creche-mates as deeply shameful -- all of these resounding values arise from this social glue of gift-giving in return for service.

LOYALTY & HOSPITALITY
The household of a heda is honor-bound to respect the gifts they are given by giving good service in return. Loyalty is a highly-prized virtue, & in a dangerous & largely lawless world, it is easy to see why: there isn't an awful lot holding life together. 1 might observe that the later Anglo-Saxon obsession with written law is a result of worrying about the fragility of society where behavior is based solely on loyalty & gift-giving.
And so loyalty really matters in the Age of Heroes, & is a consistent moral theme of Anglo-Saxon poetry. 
A ruler of any repute will maintain a household of warriors -- a hearth guard -- providing them with war gear & gifts to ensure their service & bind their loyalty to them. These warriors will live in the longhouse or close by. 
Warriors who have taken gifts from a lord are expected to follow him or her to death. Surviving a battle in which one's ruler falls is 1 of the most shameful things to befall a warrior. While a warrior is in the service of a ruler, they are expected to offer complete loyalty.
Similarly a leader is expected to share their wealth appropriately, & be wise in who they favor.
The tradition of giving gifts in exchange for good behavior extends beyond the walls of a longhouse. Hospitality is a very important virtue, & 1 which echoes the ring-giving of a ruler. 
In a world without a dedicated hospitality industry, without inns or hotels, offering hospitality, & respecting its rules is of vital importance.
Giving a stranger shelter & food is the measure of your decency. 
Accepting hospitality, & respecting the laws of the house are equally important: physically attacking a host or a guest once they have been welcomed to share a hearth is unthinkable, outside of the direst provocation.
Reputation matters: being in a position to be generous, & also being able to display wealth, is a display of reputation -- not solely for wealth's sake, but because it shows you have _won favor by being a good person_.

PERSONAL WEALTH
The vast majority of people around the Whale Road display their wealth about their person, in the form of jewelry & decorated goods. While most buildings are little more than large huts, jeweled & enameled cloak pins & brooches are commonly worn, & can run the gamut of worth from a basic copper pin to a priceless enameled master-crafted golden brooch. The poorest person might well own a carved wooden or antler comb, made wonderful with interlaced carvings.
Arm rings of precious metals are common, as are neck & finger rings. Belt buckles & strap ends can be highly embellished with fine interlaced & geometric patterns. jewelry is frequently decorated with animal designs & has its own language of symbolism which varies by location.
Clothing for most people is typically a couple of layered & belted tunics over trousers, which are bound below the knee to keep them from flapping in wet & muddy conditions. Cloaks are commonly worn, fixed with a decorated pin. 
In common with most eras in history, women often cover their hair with a cloth covering. Aprons for women are common in domestic settings. Women traditionally wear strings of glass & amber beads between 2 brooches on their aprons.
Clothes are commonly made of wool, flax & linen, dyed in bright colors, & edged with attractive woven borders.

No Inns!
In the world of the Whale Road there are no inns to be found -- they haven't been invented yet! longhouses provide a place for newcomers & travelers to sleep, bringing them right to the heart of the community to both display largesse, but also to keep an eye on them! In places without a longhouse, travelers who observe the laws of hospitality can expect to find a welcome at any hearth, & if they are turned away or treated meanly as a guest? Well that is the beginning of many a tale. It is shameful for a host to be unable to spare food & lodging for the night, & equally shameful for a guest to behave poorly in response to hospitality given.
In all of these customs -- loyalty, hospitality, ring-giving, personal reputation, longhouses -- we see the results of a low-population, agriculturally based, largely pre-literate, warrior society. The roots of these customs, in providing & protecting social order, where little else exists to do it, are worth remembering when playing BEOWULF. There aren't a lot of people about, society is agricultural, there are only small amounts of specialization & division of labour, & so communities all rely on 1 another to some degree. Social order is not enforced by any dedicated group of police or watch, & authority comes very directly from the support of the people, & if not, it comes directly from strength of arms.

WERGELD
In a society where there is no written law, & no centralized municipal authority to enforce it, & where gift giving is the basis of community, & displayed wealth is a symbol of your goodness, a human life has a traditional worth in silver. “Wergeld”, literally “man-gold”.
This life-price is traditionally paid to the family of anyone who is killed, whether in anger or by accident. Most often this is paid by the killer, or the person deemed responsible for the death, & it is meant to end any likely feud. The price to be paid varies by the social standing of the person who died.
Wergeld might also be paid by a ruler to settle a dispute. In a settlement with limited individuals & resources, keeping the peace is a tricky & important business! It is significant to note that by incurring a fine of wergeld an individual is not only being punished by way of the immediate loss of wealth, as we would see a legal fine today. The person paying wergeld is losing part of their future ability to display wealth, & give hospitality. This marks them out socially as a less-good person.

COMMON PEOPLE
In historical Anglo-Saxon society, especially in late Saxon times, we see complex strata of social classes. In the ancestral Age of Heroes this is of less significance. Most people in the Age of Heroes are simple folk: subsistence farmers living in extended family groups that span 3 generations, within a day's walk or ride of a longhouse. The head of a poor household probably owns a spear, & might be called to join battle as part of a body of fighting people called a fyrd. Most hope to leave battle to warriors who live in & around a longhouse in more direct service of the local ruler, & richer, more powerful farmers who are likely to own more elaborate wargear.. To that end they're happy to deliver a portion of their produce to the local chieftain.
A farm or smallholding looks & functions much like a longhouse on a smaller scale. There is a central longhouse where an extended family lives, cooks & socialises. A proportion of the building will be given over to housing animals, which provide additional heat. The head of the household determines what the people living together do, & what they receive in return. 
The people who live in a dwelling like this are expected to share the beliefs of their ruler, but they might not do so. Provided they do not openly spread dissent, such differences can be overlooked in the name of the general peace.

SLAVES & SLAVERY
Slavery was an aspect of Anglo-Saxon life, although it is not mentioned in the poem Beowulf. It is important to make 2 points around slavery. 
Firstly, if the topic of slavery is something you are understandably unhappy with including, then simply ignore it & do not include it. It is not a feature of the Beowulf poem, & there is no pressing need for a heroic adventure tale to bother itself with such things. It is not a necessary inclusion for “realism” in a game featuring monsters.
Secondly, if slavery is something you do choose to include, it is important to draw the distinction between the unprecedentedly cruel & racist slavery of the transatlantic slave trade, & Anglo-Saxon slavery. While equivocating on degrees of slavery has clear dangers, in Anglo-Saxon times slavery was not based on what we now call “race” -- a concept that would be likely unrecognisable to an Anglo-Saxon. It was also possible for slaves to own possessions & money, & eventually work their way out of slavery. 
In lean times, historically, poor families would sell themselves into the state of slavery rather than starve, with the hope they could later buy their freedom, & there existed clear laws on the treatment of slaves, which were much more benevolent than those of the transatlantic slave trade a millennium later. See page 72 for more details.
The rise of the church saw mass-freeing of slaves in Anglo-Saxon England, & the same is true in our fictional Whale Road. Upon conversion, the 1st thing a king or queen is likely to do is to free all the slaves in their kingdom. All of these things might prove useful springboards for a story.

SCOPS & POETRY
Within society there are some professions which are considered special. Scops are the storytellers, minstrels & poets of the age. They might wander the land, earning their living by telling tales in a new place each night. Or they might be resident at a longhouse. Scops help preserve order with their instructional tales, & they are the bringers of news & relaters of reputations. As such, they enjoy some protections beyond the common laws of hospitality. No ruler of any repute would harm, or allow harm to befall a scop.
Everything that happens in a BEOWULF: Age of Heroes game is considered part of a scop's tale, or even the retelling of the scop's tale. Thus all inconsistencies & deviations from strict history are excused. The GM need not have an encyclopaedic knowledge of Anglo-Saxon history or myth, since the world is a wide one, stories are handed down from every age, & every scop tells the tale in a different way.

WYRD
A deeply held belief in the Age of Heroes, common to all, is that of wyrd. A person's wyrd is their destiny, fate or doom. This belief that everyone has a destiny is held in common among both followers of the Old Ways & The Church. The notion of wyrd sits just as happily with the idea of the Old Gods' Wyrd Sisters, who weave the pattern of each life on their great loom at the foot of the world tree, as it does with “the will of God” for the new faith.
Wyrd is a somewhat complex idea for us modern people. It is not as simple as a preordained future. It's a mixture of unfolding events, & a force which is something akin to karma, but which depends on courage rather than good deeds.
This is a very important concept to the people of the Whale Road, & it is core to their understanding of the world & life. 
Everyone has a fate, or doom, but this can be understood & influenced. Attempting to ascertain what that is, & change it, can be powerful motivations for Heroes.
Wyrd is inextricably entangled with the idea of the Hero. The special individual, chosen by fate to achieve great things. It is also very strongly linked to a mythical & poetic Northern melancholy, & sense of inevitable doom, which is an important feature of both Beowulf the poem & BEOWULF the game setting.
A belief in wyrd means that divination is very significant in the lives of people around the Whale Road. Omens & portents can be found all around, if 1 only knows how to read them. 
Portentous predictions of the future might spring unbidden into the minds of those sensitive to them, or might be read in animal entrails, or the flight of birds. The drawing of rune stones, or the shaking of sticks can also be used to divine the future.
Women are thought to be better at divination & seeing the future than men, & the word wyrd in Old Germanic is a feminine noun. Wise women are common to both the Church & the Old Ways, & there's a clear continuity between the two. A ruler might consult the omens with a priestess of Freya, or might travel to an Abbey to consult with the nuns there on courses of action.

NEW RULES

This section introduces the new 5e rules that accompany, & are intertwined with, the BEOWULF setting. It is intended to provide both an introduction now & reference section for later.  
These rules have been specially designed to help you create stories that evoke the feeling of mythic adventures in the ancestral Anglo-Saxon world for just 1 Player & 1 GM, while layering onto the 5e rules set you already know.  

OF HEROES  

The Hero Class  
The Hero class features 6 subclasses, each of which are centered around a Stat. There are no so-called “races” in the world of BEOWULF: all Heroes are human beings. The benefits gained from a character's heritage in the regular 5e rules are here folded into their background. During character creation simply skip the “race” selection step.  
The full details of the Hero Class are on page 48.  

Alignment around the Whale Road  
Heroes are assumed to be largely “good” in nature, & driven to help those in need of help. Or, at the very least, they are driven to accidentally do good by fighting Monsters. Rather than choosing a traditional alignment, Heroes decide whether they follow the Old Ways of the traditional gods like Woden, Thunor & Tir, or if they follow the newer teachings of the Church. Some Heroes remain decidedly on the fence, picking to follow neither, or both (Neutral). Traditional alignment from 5e does not play a part in BEOWULF: Age of Heroes.

Wyrd  
Wyrd is a person's fate, doom or destiny. Heroes have a very strong sense of wyrd, & thereby gain the ability to access the advantages of being singled out by the Old Gods, the will of the God of the Church, or simply by luck.  
Due to the influence of their fated destiny, a Hero can use an alignment die. The die used is dependent on the Hero's alignment.  

Using the alignment die  
The alignment die is part of having a Heroic Wyrd. Whenever a Hero makes a roll with +Adv, they may choose 1 of the dice they are about to roll to be representative of their alignment -- be it the will of the Old Gods, a respect of tradition, a divine omen, or a part of the God of the Book's divine plan. 
If that die is then selected to be the result of the roll, then the Hero gains +1 Inspiration, whether the roll succeeds or not. They might take a loss in the short term on a failed roll, but are rewarded with Inspiration by their Wyrd -- their Fate. It's helpful to roll d20s of different colors to make identification that much easier.  
There is no limit to the number of times a Player may use an alignment die.

Alignment Die: Before you roll with +Adv, choose 1 of the d20s to be your alignment die. If you select that die as the result you gain +1 Inspiration.  

Followers  
By virtue of being Heroes, player-characters enjoy the company of a number of Followers. Followers are a new kind of NPC who are considered to be in the company of the Hero, unless otherwise directed or stated.
Followers step in & out of the limelight as required, & otherwise just appear in the background, without needing much attention.  
Followers have a number of features called gifts which can be deployed by the Player. You can read about Followers in more detail on page 82.  

Ships  
Every Hero begins their life of adventure with the ship & crew needed to navigate the Whale Road. Heroes also always have access to a replacement ship should theirs be lost. There is always a story-based explanation for where a new ship comes from, whether it is a gift from a local ruler, or won from pirates, or an abstraction of hitching a lift to a friendly harbor & there being gifted a ship by a local personage of importance.  
A Hero can always find a ship, or do what is necessary to return to the state of owning a ship. Even if it takes a little time & involves a little bit of story to get there.  
Ships enjoy their own set of new rules. You can find them on page 74.

The Ship's Crew  
The crew of a Hero's ship are considered even further into the background than Followers. They have their own special rules on page 74.  

Gifts & Burdens for Ships & other Items  
Uniquely in BEOWULF, NPCs & items have or can gain gifts & burdens. Gifts make items & NPCs stronger or more powerful, while burdens make items or NPCs weaker or less powerful. Ships, swords, Followers can all enjoy both gifts & burdens. These are collectively referred to as “tags”. Sometimes tags are called out in adventures to allow special new options to be explored.  

Equipment & Wargear  
BEOWULF: Age of Heroes uses a unique equipment list to reflect the kinds of weapons, armor & gear found in this setting.  
Weapons & equipment also gain some new inherent properties by virtue of this being a setting aimed primarily at duet play. With 1 Player, there is more time to consider options without boring anyone else. With a very strong setting focus, there are special rules designed to reflect the special kinds of fighting encountered in the Age of Heroes.  
Shields & helmets are more useful than in regular 5e games, & some weapons possess extra properties to circumvent shields & helmets. armor types in BEOWULF are more limited in type, but a little more varied within those types: heroes wear a lot of mail.  
You can read more about new inherent properties, gifts & burdens for wargear on page 6.

Spears Are Always Available  
In the Age of Heroes, a Hero can always find a spear. Whether a Follower passes 1 to the Hero, whether there's 1 in the hold of the ship, or a freshly encountered NPC is prepared to make a gift of a spear, a Hero can always lay hands on this signature weapon of the age.  
Rather than make the Player tortuously explain how they acquire a weapon if needed, we simply state a spear is always available.

OF ADVENTURE  

The Portent  
The portent is a piece of poetry randomly created at the beginning of an adventure. It might represent the reading of omens, a message from God or the gods. It might be a snatch of a song overheard by the Hero, or the prophesy of a wise member of the ship's crew. The delivery of the portent can take many forms.  
The portent is created by the Player rolling dice, & the results create a line of verse as well as stocking the Inspiration pool (see below). The GM also uses the results to generate some encounters for the voyage the Hero inevitably undertakes.

The Inspiration Pool  
The Inspiration pool is a unique addition to the 5e rule set. Inspiration tokens are allotted to 3 different groups, which can be accessed during the adventure in different ways. This can make the adventure a little easier (and more decidedly heroic) for the Player, or a little more challenging if things don't go their way. The 3 different groups within the Inspiration pool are:  

- The Hero pool, which the Player can access when they need some Inspiration. In order to gain Inspiration from the Hero pool, the Player must in some way link the current events to the text of the Portent.  
- The Follower pool can be used to give Followers the benefit of Inspiration. In order to gain Inspiration from the Follower pool, the Player must in some way link the current events to the text of the Portent.  
- The Monster pool is for the GM to use. In order to gain Inspiration from the Monster pool, the GM must in some way link the current events to the text of the Portent.  

A Hero or Follower or Monster can only have Inspiration or not have it: Inspiration in BEOWULF works the same as it does in the core 5e rules. Inspiration cannot be stacked.
A Player can draw an Inspiration token from the pool & save it for later use, provided they can link events to the content of the Portent.  
The Inspiration Pool is not restocked during an adventure & once used, Inspiration tokens from the Pool are put to the side. They do not return to the pool. You can read more about the Inspiration Pool on page 97.  

Voyages  
Every adventure in the Age of Heroes begins with a sea voyage. The setting is made up of settlements flung far & wide around the Whale Road, & so a journey by ship is almost always necessary. The Voyage rules provide some brief encounters to begin the adventure, & get things started. They are also intended to interact with Followers more than the Hero, emulating the kinds of episodes we see in epic stories & sagas of sea voyages.  
Voyages at sea are not intended to be a main focus of BEOWULF adventures, but these rules provide a little thematic color & set up the manner in which the Hero arrives.  

Social Stat Block  
BEOWULF introduces the idea of foreground NPCs who use a special stat block. This stat block formally sets out their motivations, what they know about the mystery of the Monster, & structures the way in which the Hero can access their favor or displeasure.  
The purpose of the social stat block is to aid the GM in the structuring an investigation into the nature of the Monster & how it can be defeated. Using this option allows for webs of interconnected NPCs to be built up relatively simply & consistently. You can read more about the social stat block on page 111.

The Defeated condition  
In the Age of Heroes not all adversaries need to be slain in order to overcome them. While HP are intended to be something of an abstraction and, just as in the core 5e rules, reaching zero HP does not necessarily mean death, BEOWULF takes that a little further with the  
**Defeated condition**: This is intended to save the singular Player from protracted combats, to add some variety to battles, to reflect the themes of the setting where skirmishes are not necessarily fought to the death, & to prevent the goodly Hero from having to murder everyone who crosses their path with ill-intent.  
Most creatures in BEOWULF have a criteria in their stat block under which they gain the Defeated condition. While subject to the Defeated condition a creature may not attack. Such a creature is no longer a threat to anyone, & will seek to act in self preservation, rather than aggressively.

Examples of criteria to gain the Defeated condition:  
- When a friendly creature within sight is wounded this creature becomes defeated.  
- When this creature's shield is broken it becomes defeated.  
- When this creature reaches half of its MaxHP it becomes defeated.  
- When half of this creature's allies are killed it becomes defeated.  
- When this creature is in sunlight it becomes defeated.  
- When this creature is damaged by fire it becomes defeated.

Creatures may respond differently to being defeated, & how they do so is up to the adventure & the GM. Once subject to the Defeated condition a creature may:  
- have its fighting spirit broken & will immediately attempt to flee, never to be seen again  
- surrender to the creature who inflicted the Defeated condition  
- become doomed to die from wounds, slinking away never to be seen again  
- be in some way disarmed, or transformed  
- become vulnerable to suggestion or command by a Hero  
- be permanently pinned, imprisoned or immobilized  
- become harmless in some other way the GM invents to fit the circumstances

As a rule of thumb, the majority of mundane adversaries will simply flee or surrender when defeated. It is important to note that when subject to the Defeated condition, the creature will respond in good faith, & is always genuinely defeated. This is suited to the kind of mythic, saga-logic of Beowulf the poem & BEOWULF the game. While a wily creature may use the appearance of being defeated as a trick, no creature should ever break the rules of the actual Defeated condition in order to trick the Hero. Defeated is defeated.

Monsters & monsters  
BEOWULF introduces the concept of the capital-M Monster. A Monster is the “big bad”, the climactic adversary of an adventure, & the focus of a Hero's quest. These Monsters enjoy some slightly different concepts than the average adversary. You can read more about adversaries & Monsters on page 181.  

Undefeatable  
Undefeatable is a special trait possessed by some creatures. It is generally reserved for capital-M Monsters. Seeking the method by which this trait might be removed is frequently the core task at the heart of a BEOWULF adventure.  
**Undefeatable**: This creature is immune to the Defeated condition. When an undefeatable creature takes damage from any source it only takes 1 point of damage.

Achievement XP  
BEOWULF offers an optional advancement system in addition to those found in the core 5e rules. Achievement XP offers a list of achievements within a scenario. Once a certain number of these achievements have been unlocked, the Hero levels up. This allows the GM to set both heroic deeds that count towards advancement, alongside more thematic or tonal rewards, as well as providing the potential for special achievements & discoveries outside of the usual XP awards. You can read more about Achievement XP on page 130.

Treasure  
Treasure in BEOWULF is measured on pounds of silver (£). Most treasure is comprised of decorative goods like arm rings, neck rings, enameled cloak pins, precious drinking vessels & the like. Coins also exist, & many communities rely on barter. For convenience, treasure & prices are rated in pounds of silver. Precisely what comprises those pounds of silver is often up to the GM & the Player to narrate.

Journaling  
Followers also introduce a unique new feature of BEOWULF: Age of Heroes: downtime player journaling. Between sessions, the Player may choose to write a story of the exploits of their chosen Follower, & thereby develop that Follower's abilities & deepen their character. So while the GM creates the next adventure, the Player also has an active role to play.  
You can find out more about downtime journals & journaling on page 134.

Background
Choose 1:

Adrft
You have no clear memories of your past, at least up to a certain point. You might have suffered an accident or been wounded in battle. No matter the cause, your personal history is currently a mystery to you.
Skills: Insight, Perception.
Tools: Any 1 of your choice.
Gear: 1 of... a book in a language you can't read, an engraving of a person or group of people you don't remember, a music instrument or tool kit that you don't remember how to use.
Feature: Familiar Faces
1/Adventure, you can spend -1 Inspiration & select an NPC. That character knows something of your Hero, though it may be difficult to learn that info if the NPC is hostile or indifferent to the Hero. If it requires effort to learn something from the character, the Hero receives either an Advancement award or Meeting XP for their level (see pg 134) for successfully revealing it. If the NPC is Friendly, then they should provide assistance to the Hero during at least 1 scene in the adventure.

Avenger
Only the most foolish & those soft people of overgrown longhouses say that there are no monsters in the world. But you never doubted & never will -- such a monster killed your family. You might have hidden from the monster or been absent because of some errand, but it's certain that only chance allowed you to live. You've sworn an oath -- you'll destroy the monster that slew your kin.
Skills: Nature, Survival.
Tools: Any 1.
Gear: An heirloom of those you lost.
Feature: Power in Sorrow
Your grief does provide 1 benefit to you & that is that you will not relent until you have fulfilled your oath. 1/Long Rest, when you are reduced to zero HP you can use this feature to restore 1HP.

Chosen One
You were selected by some sort of prophecy, perhaps as a young child or when you came of age. There's some purpose that you must complete & your people have made sure you know it. You never had any choice about pursuing this mission, the prophecy made those decisions for you.
Skills: Legends, & either Religion or Insight.
Tools: Any 1.
Gear: Letters or a book of philosophy about the prophecy, a kit for your tool prof.
Feature: Touched by Prophecy
You have some sense of how your life is supposed to unfold & are very sensitive to any deviation from that plan. 1/Long Rest, when a Nat1 or Nat20 is rolled, you can choose to reroll that die, once.

Noble's Blood
You are a born leader, perhaps the child of a chieftan, noble family, or even a royal. While your station benefits you greatly, you also keenly feel the weight of expectations upon you. For this reason or another, you have decided to go forth & prove yourself in the world before returning to your responsibilities in your homeland.
Skills: Legends, Persuade.
Tools: Any 1.
Gear: A signet ring or other symbol of your station, a kit for your tool prof.
Feature: Command Presence
You are used to the burdens of leadership & know how to motivate people to exceptional prowess. As an action 1/LongRest, you can revive a Spent Follower or restore HD= your ProfB to a character (they cannot recover more than their MaxHD).

The Foundling
You might have been orphaned by disease or war, or found as a mysterious stranger as a child. In any case, you do not have a secure place in your homeland, for whoever took you in cannot claim you by blood. Thus, you have ranged out, looking for new opportunities & perhaps some knowledge of your bitter past.
Skills: Animal Handling, Survival.
Tools: Any 1.
Gear: A tool kit of your prof, some memento of your original home.
Feature: Ready Mind
You are used to dangerous & unpredictable situations. 1/Short Rest, you can grant yourself +Adv on your Initiative roll as long as you aren't surprised.

The Believer
You are an ardent believer in your faith & strive to promote it. If your alignment is The Church then you feel compelled to spread the word of Heaven & its vision of peace. If your alignment is the Old Ways then you instead strive against the new teachings, & are certain that the world is doomed to a great darkness out of which a new world will be born. If you are Neutral then you profess balance, taking the best teachings of The Church along with the wisdom of the Old Ways.
Skills: Persuade, Religion.
Tools: Any 1.
Gear: Either a prayer book or religious trapping (idol, symbol, etc.), a kit of your tool choice.
Feature: Power of Faith
Your alignment is of the utmost importance to you & it manifests in an understanding that others do not possess. When you roll with +Adv & use your Alignment Die (see page 28), you can choose to have +Adv on your next roll as well. (You can still pick either die's value as your result.) Once you do this, you cannot use this feature again until you take a Long Rest.

Former Follower
You used to be in the service of another hero until they declared  
that you were ready to adventure on your own. Now you are the  
master of your own destiny & no longer a servant of another's  
fate.
Skills: Athletics, Legends.
Tools: Any 1.
Gear: A kit to match your tool choice, some heirloom of your past (not weapons or armor but something else).

Exile
You were cast out from your homeland after some transgression. Now you wander the lands, perhaps looking for a new home, absolution from your crimes or perhaps the release of death itself.
Skills: Persuade, Survival.
Tools: Any 1.
Gear: A memento of your homeland, a kit for your tool choice.
Feature: Seasoned Diplomat
You are used to dealing with many different people & have learned how to interact with them without giving offence (perhaps by bitter experience). During a social interaction, if you fail a check by 5 or more, you instead use the 1st failure entry.

The Hero Class

HEROIC DESTINY  
A Hero is not merely someone tough, nor someone who is adored. A Hero is the chosen of the Wyrd Sisters that weave every person's fate, singled out to do the impossible. To travel where others cannot go, & to perform impossible deeds. Not merely well-trained, clever or strong, a Hero is different.  
Capable of navigating the seas of adventure alone, while also drawing to them a band of trusted companions, a Hero is a unique figure, doomed to have stories told of their exploits for evermore.  
A Hero is driven to help, to use their extraordinary potential in the service of others, & to oppose the Monsters who ordinary men & women cannot hope to defeat.  
Whether it is in order to be remembered, to make a good death, make peace with the past, or simply to do the right thing, is a matter for the heart of each Hero.

STRENGTH OF ARMS  
favored by wyrd as they are, a Hero can take more punishment, & in turn deliver a punishing wound-dole.They are blessed with a ship & crew, & Followers besides. & when they act in concert with their wyrd, their powers are all the greater

CREATING A HERO  
As you make your character, think about what called them to the life of the Hero, & the kinds of battles they will undertake.  
Think about what drove your character to face fearful dangers around the Whale Road.  
Do they simply wish to challenge themselves, or are they trying to prove something to somebody else? Are you searching for someone or something? Did your Hero commit some terrible deed for which they must atone, or are they simply driven by a need to serve a greater good? Do they seek fame & glory? Or do they just desire to see as much of the world as possible?  
Consider how they feel about home. Do they long to return, or do they avoid doing so? Perhaps they are conflicted: thinking fondly of home, but also craving new adventures & new friendships. Or perhaps when they are with their companions aboard ship, or in a strange new land, they have all the sense of home they need.

CLASS FEATURES  
As a Hero, you gain the following class features.  
HD: 1d8/Lv  
HP: 10+CON score  

Profs  

Armor: All armor, shields.

You must use your action to make the check & then your action on a subsequent turn to reveal the creature's secret. You must take a Long Rest before using this feature again.

Honey-Tongued (CHA Heroic Tale)
The most charismatic of Heroes, the Honey-tongued are experts in people, skilled in the ways of swaying others to their way of thinking. Whether very attractive to the eye, simply delightfully charming, or extremely forceful in will, this kind of Hero has no problem in gathering others to their cause

Glamour  
When you choose this tale at Lv1, strangers are easily awed by you. If you spend -1 Inspiration on your 1st CHA check with a stranger, success will produce a dramatic or improbable result. What this means is up to your GM, but examples might be a guard defying orders to let you pass, a hostile enemy backing down from a fight, or a suspicious chieftain suddenly taking you into their confidence.

Heroic Presence  
Beginning at Lv3, when another creature within 30ft of you that can see you makes an ability check, Save, or attack roll, as a reaction you can cause the roll to be made with your choice of +Adv or -DisAdv. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your CHA (minimum 1). You regain all uses on a Short or Long Rest.

Force of Personality  
At Lv7, you & friendly creatures within 10ft have +Adv on Saves vs Charms & Enchantments.

Clarity of Mind  
Starting at Lv10, as an Action you can spend -1 Inspiration to try to dispel a magical effect on another creature. Make an Intimidation or Persuasion (your choice) check versus the original Save DC. If there was no original Save, use 10+Spell Slot Lv used, or the lowest Lv the spell can be cast at for innate magic. On a success, the creature is freed from the effect. After using this ability you must take a Short or Long Rest before using it again.

Peacemaker  
Starting at Lv14, as an action you may attempt to halt a combat. Each creature within 60ft who can hear & understand you must make a WIS Save, DC=8+ProfBonus+CHA. A creature that fails the save takes the Dodge action on its turn. At the beginning of your next turn if no 1 has made an attack roll since your last turn the combat ends & you can speak for up to 1 minute. Afterwards, the combat might resume, depending on the GM's ruling. You must take a Short or Long Rest before using this feature again.

Instill Doubt  
At Lv18 you can spend a bonus action to give a creature the following feature:  
**Defeatable**: This creature gains the Defeated condition if you use your Action & succeed at a Intimidate check with the DC=20+(2x creature's CHA) & the creature's current HP total is lower than yours. You must take a Long Rest before using this feature again.

EQUIPMENT & SHIPS
Though Heroes in BEOWULF would readily do battle with bare hands, it is an unusual warrior which possesses no weapons or armor. Similarly, every character relies on their Followers, their crew & their ship to deliver them to their adventures. This chapter covers both the wargear & ships of Heroes but also the concerns of ordinary folk, to help the Gamemaster bring the world to life.

WEALTH & CURRENCY  
The kings & queens of BEOWULF might have won their land by conquest but they maintain it by being ring-givers who reward service with treasure. A Hero is rewarded richly for their service, often receiving treasure equivalent to several pounds of silver.  
They in turn spend money for the upkeep (or betterment) of their ship, to reward their Followers & pay their crew.  
In prepared adventures we often provide a simple monetary value expressed as pounds of silver (£) given to a Hero, but the actual rewards might well be bands of gold, chests of silver pennies, precious gems, intricate pieces of jewelry & other precious objects. For simplicity's sake, all wealth can be expressed in £ of silver, & we don't worry too much about the precise constituents making up that wealth.  
From their reward-hoard, a Hero is expected to provide lesser treasures to their Followers, each of which has a minimum price to keep them happy (pages 86-87). This price is measured in shillings (abbreviated 's'). In the days of our tales, the value of shillings varied wildly from place to place & from time to time, but for convenience we have set the standard exchange rate at 40 shillings to 1£.  
The crew of the ship must also be paid, which is normally done from the upkeep cost. But a wise Hero might wish to reward their crew for their efforts. But even a shilling is too much wealth for regular folk's everyday business. So they will likely be paid with silver pennies. Again, the value of these pennies ranges considerably but we will set ours at 6 pence to the shilling as a matter of course. Traditionally, these coins were abbreviated 'd' (for the Latin denarius) but we will make 1 more consideration & use 'p' for pennies instead.  
In review:  

1£=40s & 1s = 6p, 
so 1£=40s=240p  

For the most part, the lands around the Whale Road rely on barter & gift giving, but that sits alongside the convenience of coin-based currency.

WARGEAR  
Weapons, armor, shields & headgear comprise your Hero's wargear. For BEOWULF, the heavy armors found in other settings are not available. In the Age of Heroes your shield & your helmet are more important pieces of equipment.

Weaponshirt: This warrior's undergarment, worn beneath all kinds of mail offers some protection in its own right. Padded with horsehair or wads of rags, or layers of cloth, the weaponshirt gives warriors a bulkier, more imposing appearance. Generally made of linen, a weaponshirt might be made of animal hide or leather.
Type: light
Cost: 1£
AC: 11+DEX
Weight: 8lb

Iron-ribbed Helm: A common metal helmet, constructed from several plates, reinforced by iron ribs. Sometimes just a metal cap, sometimes with cheek pieces & nasal guard. Where a nasal is present, metal eyebrows or spectacles might also be found.
Type: medium
Cost: 1£
AC: +1
Weight: 3lb

Mail Corslet: A sleeveless, or short-sleeved shirt of interlinking iron links, with every 4th link riveted together. When worn it's assumed to be worn over a weaponshirt, the benefit of which is included in its statistics.
Type: medium
Cost: 4£
AC: 13+DEX (max2)
Weight: 20lb

Scale Harness: A rare kind of protection, scale mail is made of many overlapping metal plates like the scales of a fish. More commonly found in the mysterious lands to the south, scale gives a very impressive appearance, & so is favored by those Heroes looking to be noticed.
Type: medium
Cost: 2£
AC: 14+DEX (max2)
Weight: 45lb
Properties: Noisy

Crested Helm: As every child around the hearth knows, a crest atop a helmet provides extra protection, & it makes a Hero even more visible on the field of battle.
Type: medium
Cost: 3£
AC: +1
Weight: 4lb
Properties: Robust

Masked Helm: A helm that includes a full faceplate is a treasure of great worth. The battle mask is most often worked into the likeness of a Hero or god of battle, & is an unnerving piece of wargear to encounter on the battlefield. The enclosed nature of the masked helm provides extra protection against blows.
Type: heavy
Cost: 10£
AC: +2
Weight: 8lb
Properties: Noisy, Robust

Long-sleeved Byrnie: A harness of close-fitted mail which includes full arm covering, & a short apron of mail over the upper legs. When worn it's assumed to be worn over a weaponshirt, the benefit of which is included in its stats.
Type: heavy
Cost: 10£
AC: 15
Weight: 40lb
Properties: Noisy

Knee-length Hauberk: A great harness of mail which covers from the knees to the chin. Often donned by the most prodigious of thegns & favored warriors, a hauberk of this type is a mighty gift or expensive purchase. When worn it is assumed to be worn over a weaponshirt, the benefit of which is included in its stats.
Type: heavy
Cost: 15£
AC: 16
Requires: STR 1+

Shields
As ubiquitous as the spear, almost all warriors carry a shield as an essential piece of protective equipment. Round in shape, & built from flexible wooden planks, a shield is surprisingly light & mobile. All shields are held by a grip in a central iron boss, which is riveted to the planks. The shield's face is covered with painted leather or linen to give the planks more strength. With sufficient skill, a shield can be used as a secondary weapon, to attack as well as defend. A strap attached to the boss can be used to carry the shield from your shoulder when not in use.

Cone-boss Shield: Fitted with a protruding iron boss, this shield is easy to use offensively.
Type: shield
Cost: 3s
AC: +2
Weight: 6lb
Properties: Battering

Metal-rimmed Shield: Making the shield heavier, a rim of iron also protects it against blows to the edge, making it more robust & harder to splinter.
Type: shield
Cost: 10s
AC: +2
Weight: 8lb
Properties: Robust

**Axe**: A common tool, cheap & versatile. Burdened with provincial overtones -- that is to say, warriors of renown tend to look upon the simple axe as beneath them. Or more practically, if a smith is forging an axe they may as well make a pair of spears. But a Hero of humble background may choose to wield an axe as a marker of their origins. An axe can be thrown, & carrying of a brace of axes demonstrates murderous intent or ability.

**Club**: Simple to make & readily available, the club is a weapon steeped in mythological overtones. A Hero that wields a simple club must be pure of purpose & a formidable foe.

**Javelin**: A very common spear variation of the age -- almost every warrior who can afford to do so will carry 2 or 3 javelins in their off-hand, ready to be flung at enemies as shield walls close. The javelin is a shield-killer; it has a ling thin barbed head specifically designed to pierce shields & bend to render the shield too cumbersome to use. Javelins are sometimes looked down upon by more grand warriors, but are nonetheless extremely useful in war.

**Shiv**: A single edged large knife of considerable refinement & complexity of shape, the shiv is usually worn hung horizontally on the belt within easy grasp. It is the perfect weapon for fighting in the shield wall, & while it can cut it also has a long stabbing point for piercing mail between shields. There are many beautiful variations on the design of the shiv, & its accompanying decorated sheath. Traditionally, women wore a shiv hung on a cord around the neck or hidden on the thigh.

**Spear**: The spear is by far the most common weapon found around the Whale Road in the Age of Heroes. Relatively simple to make in its common form, easy to use, the spear is made of a pointed, double-edged iron head with a split socket for the shaft, which is hammered shut & riveted. The shaft is usually made of ash, but hazel & oak are not uncommon. More unusually a spear shaft might be made from apple wood or maple. Some spear heads are long, & designed to pierce mail, others are broader & intended to be used with a cutting motion. The head of a spear can be as cleverly made as a sword blade, rich with pattern-welded snake patterns. Shafts are often painted or stained, & decorated with metal rings. A spear is always available to a Hero -- whether a Follower has a spare, is happy to give up their own, or there's 1 in the hold of the Hero's ship, a spear can always be found when needed. A local ruler will always be happy to gift a Hero a spear.

**Staff**: While not a commonly used weapon, a large trimmed stick can certainly be wielded by a warrior to significant effect. Most commonly made of ash, staves might be made of oak, alder or even yew. It might be decorated & stained like a spear shaft, though this would be an unusual weapon when spears are so common & effective.

**Hunting Bow**: While not designed for use in war, a bow that can bring down a deer can certainly inflict wounds on a human. Also commonly found in any community.

**Sling**: The traditional weapon of a youngster, a sling is not to be underestimated. Considerable skill is required to use a sling to hit & kill the predator that threatens a family, & someone who can do that can certainly use it to serious effect against other foes. The sling is another weapon rich in the stuff of folklore & makes a memorable weapon as the signature of a Hero.

**Warhammer**: An combination weapon specifically made for war, the warhammer has a hooked “beak” opposite its hammer face, which is designed to hook an opponent's shield. Often very graceful in design, a warhammer is a fearsome anti-shield weapon.

**Battle Axe**: A long-hafted heavy-headed axe, the battle axe is feared across the length & breadth of the Whale Road. A shield splitter, & mail breaker, using a battle axe is the choice of the bravest warriors, who forego the use of a shield in order to increase their offensive power.

**War Club**: Crude, but effective, a great hunk of tree limb used as a weapon. Ripe for becoming the signature war tool of a Hero, a great club might be favored by those who cannot afford iron, or by those who wish to signal they do not relish the spilling of blood. Of course, there is no doubt that a blow from a great two-handed club will spill blood as readily as any spear point.

**Dagger**: A single edged long knife, with a similar shaped blade to the shiv. Sometimes hilted like a more conventional double-edged sword, the dagger might not have any kind of cross guard. Some might argue that all knives are the same, be they knife or sword-sized. Those Heroes who fight with dagger beg to differ.

**Sword**: The sword is the king of weapons. It is largely symbolic of high status & professional warriors, & what better weapon for a Hero? A sword has no function as a tool, & is purely the domain of a warrior. Scabbards are scarcely less impressive, heavily ornamented & decorated. The hilt of a sword might well be ornamented with a ring, symbolizing the owner's service to a ruler.

**Winged Spear**: A specialized spear with a cross piece fitted across the base of the head. This is designed to hook an enemy's shield & pull it away from them, allowing blows to slide past.

**War Bow**: A heavy bow, designed with the slaughter of warriors in mind. Strong enough to pierce the links of mail, & with much greater range than a simple hunter's bow. A war bow is fashioned of a single piece of yew, with the heartwood providing strength & the sap wood elasticity. The string of a war bow is made of horse hair or animal gut. Occasionally such a bow might be made from animal horn, though the understanding of this way of making bows is not common-place.

PROPERTIES FOR WARGEAR  
For the Hero's wargear, there are 3 kinds of properties: inherent, burdens, & gifts. Inherent properties are like the ones present in the core rules, they are features that the weapon has as part of its core design & you can't add or remove them. Burdens are negative features, sometimes due to the equipment's construction, but often a result of battles. Gifts are improvements to equipment that often the Hero must seek out, might receive as a reward, or may be able to commission a craftsperson to create for them (see “Smithwork” on page 133).

New Inherent Properties  
If a property is not listed here, refer to the core rules.  

**Battering**: This weapon can be used to bash an opponent when using the Bashing Strike feat. (see page 77).  

**Hooking**: A hooking weapon has a feature which allows it to catch the rim of a shield & pull it away from the user. When you score a critical hit you can choose instead to hook the shield. A shield that has been hooked provides no bonus to AC until the beginning of the shield user's next turn. A hooked shield is considered violently pulled aside, temporarily creating an opening in the shield user's defense. It is not broken or dropped.  

**Massive**: This weapon requires STR 2+ to wield successfully; a creature using it with a lower STR does not add STR to damage.

**Noisy**: This piece of armor has multiple components that often bang together, applying -DisAdv to stealth attempts while wearing it.  

**Robust**: When using a robust shield or helmet you may spend -1 Inspiration to ignore the effects of a critical hit or splintering strike.  

**Splintering**: A splintering weapon can be used to destroy an opponent's shield or helmet. When you score a critical hit you may choose to instead splinter your opponent's shield or helmet, destroying it. Certain properties can prevent this effect.  

Burdens  
The following are negative properties that can be applied to wargear. Some burdens can be removed, it is up to the GM to assign a cost and/or time requirements -- removing a burden can be an important part of some adventures.  

**Broken**: This weapon was destroyed & no longer fully effective. If you continue to use it, any successful strike causes the minimum possible damage (e.g. if you normally do 1d6 + 3 points of damage with the weapon, you do 4 points instead)

**Inferior Materials**: When this armor receives a critical hit it is considered destroyed & no longer provides any protection. Such armor often comes with a reduced cost.  

**Weighty**: This piece of wargear is 1 & a half times its normal weight, due to its construction.

Gifts  

**Formidable**: The helmet or shield gains the robust property.  

**Hooked**: This weapon gains the hooking property.  

**Impressive**: This weapon is 1 that carries great cultural weight. A person carrying such a weapon is very likely a mighty warrior, & well-skilled in the weapon's use. They are not lightly given nor lightly owned. Carrying an Impressive weapon gives you +Adv on appropriate CHA checks.  

**Shield-boss**: This shield gains the battering property.

NORMAL GEAR  
The table on the following page gives a listing of items that are likely to be available for purchase at any sizeable settlement. However, it is likely that the ship might already have some items (see 'Ship's Stores' below) so these prices are mostly for the GM to use to represent the expenses of any common folk that the Hero meets

Buying Equipment  
The above prices represent what an average seller might expect to get for an ordinary item of that type. Most sellers are willing to make trades, & smaller villages might do a lot of business in only a notional sort of currency. The smith knows his shovel is worth at least a dozen shillings, but the butcher is going to pay him in trade & a bit of coin in order to make it easier on both of them. These prices are subject to fluctuation, especially if an impressive looking Hero-type barges into the market, jingling a purse full of heavy coins. For this reason, most Heroes prefer to assign a more discreet Follower to the task when the supplies need to be restocked. Very often, a ship will be restocked via the hospitality of a local leader. This might come with strings attached.  
A Hero enjoying the hospitality of a local ruler may well be given whatever they need by local people, provided they keep the laws of hospitality, & prove useful to the community. If they accept such gifts, there is an expectation that they will return the favor with services rendered.

Ship's Stores  
As part of preparing for & going on adventures, it is assumed that the Hero's ship is properly stocked, & there is a monthly maintenance fee that covers this & minor repairs & upkeep on the vessel. However, even the most well-stocked ship's stores are not an infinite supply cabinet. If a Hero needs an item & it's likely to be onboard ship, they can find the 1 without any trouble. If they need another, the GM will evaluate how reasonable that request is, & might deny or approve it.  
For a 3rd request, the GM is advised to deny it, unless it is an extraordinary common thing onboard ships (e.g. rope).

The Hero's Pack  
Each Hero begins with some adventuring gear assembled together in a pack. The Hero's pack includes the following: 
- A leather sleep sack, which you use aboard the ship when sleeping to keep dry & to stow your gear when not in use.  
- A thick woollen blanket  
- A tinderbox  
- 10 torches  
- 10 days of rations  
- A waterskin  
- 50ft of rope

Tools  
A tool or toolkit helps you do something that you could not normally do otherwise, like repair a ship, build a wall, or play a musical instrument. Your background or feats give you proficiency with certain tools. Proficiency with a tool allows you to +ProfBonus to any ability or skill check you make using that tool. Using a tool or toolkit is not tied to a single ability, since proficiency with a tool represents broad knowledge of its use. For example, the GM might ask you to make a DEX check to carve a fine detail with your woodcarver's tools, or a STR check to make something out of particularly hard wood. Followers often have gifts that imply their possession of a toolkit. It is assumed that some part of the rewards that they receive are used to keep that toolkit well-supplied.

| Toolkit    | £    | Weight |
| ---------- | ---- | ------ |
| brewer     | 4£   | 9lb    |
| carpenter  | 1£   | 6lb    |

*the Hero can specify a type of instrument & the GM will assign a price.

BURDENS & GIFTS FOR NORMAL GEAR  
The following are a list of modifiers for regular equipment & tools in order to present some variety to what is on offer:  

Burdens  

**Clumsy** (toolkits): This toolkit is awkwardly constructed or made for an esoteric technique. When you 1st use this tool you have -DisAdv on your checks until you succeed at a check, at which time you have adapted to the tools & make further ability checks as normal.  

**Deficient** (toolkits): This tool or set of tools is weak or lacks necessary items. When using this kit if you roll a natural 1 on your ability check then the kit is no longer functional & must be replaced before you can use it again. Such kits are usually half the cost of a better made set of tools.  

**Fragile** (tools, metal, or ceramic items): These items are easily broken. Once during the course of an adventure, you may be required to make a Save:5 to prevent damage to such an item, usually after a fall or other substantially vigorous activity.  

**Threadbare** (cloth items): This garment is shoddily made with the minimum materials needed for its construction. You gain -DisAdv on any CHA checks to impress people when wearing it or -DisAdv on any Saves vs Exhaustion or other negative environment effects when relying on its protection. Such items are usually half the normal cost or less.  

Gifts  

**Clever** (toolkits): These items are designed to make your work as easy as possible. You can spend -1 Inspiration before making a check with this tool. If you do so, instead of rolling, you are considered to have a 10 on the d20, to which you +ProfBonus+Stat as normal. If circumstances mean you should have +Adv on the check, the result is considered to be 15 instead. Such tools can be up to double the normal price.  

**Impressive** (clothing): The item is well-made, using materials & techniques beyond everyday concerns, marking you as a person of importance. While the clothes are brand-new, the 1st time you meet someone you gain +Adv on the 1st CHA checks required.  

**Sturdy** (any item): If an environmental effect (such as fire) would destroy this item you can instead remove this gift. The object survived this time, but next time it won't be so lucky. Sturdy items often sell for half again as much as a normal item (e.g. a sturdy shovel might cost 24s).  

SOCIETY & SERVICES  
Most of the time a Hero will be invited to stay at the invitation of a local lord or other ring-giver, & this invitation will extend to their Followers & maybe even crew. In such a case there are no bills to pay. But at other times the Hero will need to provide their own lodging or may be responsible for their Followers & crew. The Hero rarely deals with these expenses directly, usually sending a trusted Follower with the coin purse.  

Lodgings & Entertainment  
The following services are available in larger population areas, not every settlement or outpost will be able to provide everything listed.

| Item/Service            | £       |

Master Crafts
Many longhouses will have expert shipwrights, armor-smiths, weapon-smiths & other craftspeople attached to them. Such master crafters are able to improve equipment by adding gifts to it, & are able to remove burdens. Most commonly, the only way to access their services is at the behest of the local ruler, who may require services in return
- remove an equipment or ship burden, 2£(min)
- add an equipment or ship gift, 3£(min)

Those not directly under the patronage of a ring-giver will at the very least require an expenditure of silver to sufficiently win them over to work for the Hero. The prices listed here may or may not refer to a direct coin-based transaction, but they represent the amount of treasure that needs to be expended in the effort to secure such services. A Hero wishing to spend less silver on improving their equipment & ship might wish to invest some time in their downtime journaling (See page 134).
The Gamemaster is also encouraged to think about how such services are acquired, & how long it takes, & what further story hooks this might create. What interest might a skilled shipwright, resident at a queen's hall, have in silver? What else might they need?  

Trade Goods, Livestock & Mounts  
The following items are more likely to be available in most settlements, though there will still be exceptions.

Gifts for Animals  
The following improvements for animals can be made by spending time training the animal. See the Training activity on page 133.  

**Keen Senses** (Hound, King's Hunting Dog, Falcon or Hawk): The animal has +Adv on all Perception checks.  

**Tireless** (Horse or Ox). The animal has +Adv on Saves vs Exhaustion.

**Tough** (any animal): The animal has its maximum HP, instead of the average (for example a goat would have 8HP instead of the standard 4).  

Fines & Wergilds  
We expect both the Player & the Hero to be noble & virtuous but there may be times when they (or those that they serve) must pass out judgement upon others. While real Anglo-Saxon fines were complex & varied, we've simplified them here, focusing on 2 categories of individuals: ceorls (free folk) & thegns (soldiers, often landowners).

| Activity                                   | Fine    |

Slaves
The presence of slaves (théowas) can be a challenge for some players & there are several ways to deal with these concerns.  
It is possible to tell the stories of Heroic deeds in the lands of legends without once having to concern yourself with slaves or slavery & it can simply not exist in your games: all peoples encountered are free.  
But some may wish for a more nuanced rendering: in Anglo Saxon times, free folk sometimes sold themselves into slavery to improve their own prospects, or were captured in a raid or the aftermath of a battle. The laws of the land provide some protections for slaves, & give hope that they can win their freedom.  
The Church, with its lessons of all of humanity being equal before Heaven, is fond of emancipation whenever possible. Including the plight of the least fortunate members of society may give your Hero new ways to express their valor. If you do wish to include the 3rd class of slaves, then these fines & wergild are appropriate.

SHIPS  
In BEOWULF, all Heroes receive a ship at the outset of their life as a Hero. Along the way they may lose the ship, but such inconveniences are part of an epic tale, & a Hero will always be able to secure the return of the ship or the acquisition of a new one. The Ship is considered large enough to hold the Hero, their Followers, & the rest of the benches are filled by the Crew. The Crew don't take much part in the adventure, beyond making the ship “go”. By & large, the crew of sailors do the unglamorous work of getting the ship from A to B. We don't spend too much time thinking about them.

THE BASIC SHIPS  
Since the Hero uses the Whale Road to reach adventure, a basic ship is always available to them. Even if the worst misfortune has beset the Hero & their ship is utterly destroyed & they themselves penniless, their reputation & family name are enough to borrow a basic vessel with which to return home, or at the very least be given passage on a passing ship. Of course, a successful Hero will want to improve their transportation & they have many options to do so.  
Each ship has 2 basic values, its Speed & its Range. A sleeker ship will be quicker & thus able to pounce on an enemy vessel or escape from a dangerous sea monster. Sturdier & larger ships have more room for supplies & can last longer on the open ocean but are not as quick.

| Ship Type   | Speed    | Range          |
| ----------- | -------- | -------------- |
| Long-sided  | 24+ProfB | 2+(half ProfB) |
| Wide-beamed | 16+ProfB | 4+ProfB        |

Speed is the number of feet that the ship can move in 1 round during naval combat. It has a base value that is improved by the captain's skill (the Hero) & ship improvements (gifts, see below).
Range is the number of days that the ship can travel without needing to be resupplied. Long-sided ships have a base value & add half the Hero's ProfBonus, rounded down to represent the Hero's management & foresight. Gifts can also increase the ship's range.  
Each ship has a standard crew of 12, allowing up to 6 passengers without affecting the ship's speed or range. The Hero never counts towards these numbers. Standard ships counts as Huge in size, some gifts & burdens might change this.

THE CREW  
A beginning vessel comes with a willing crew, who are able to operate the ship in almost any condition. They are not Heroes or even Followers -- at the 1st sign of a Monster (or even some Foes) they will scatter & hide. But they can be relied upon to help the ship carry the Hero to their destination.  
For a basic vessel, the crew size is 12. The ship can be operated by only half this number (6) but it gains the Missing Crew burden (see below). The ship can carry additional passengers equal to half the crew (i.e. 6 passengers for a total of 18 people carried) without an impact on speed. More passengers means that the ship has the Encumbered burden.

More Crew  
If you are carrying more sailors than your ship has seats, those additional sailors count as passengers, not crew. You can add crew by selecting the Additional Benches gift below. This increases the normal crew size by 2, the minimum crew size by 1, & the passenger size by 1. It also reduces the Range of the ship by 1 day. A ship must have a Range of at least 1, otherwise it cannot leave port.
The Extra Stores gift increases a ship's range. Both imply either additional construction to an existing vessel or a possible upgrade to a new ship.

Followers as Crew  
Any Follower with the Sailor gift can count as a crew member instead of a passenger. Of course, Followers sometimes perish during adventures while your crew might flee a monster but are rarely in direct danger.

Ship Upkeep  
The Hero must pay 2£ per voyage for the ship's upkeep. This represents regular maintenance, crew recruitment & wages, & the restocking of regular items. Crew can be found all around the Whale Road, & any time upkeep is paid on a ship, the crew is considered to be replenished to its full complement. You might also spend money repairing the ship (to remove burdens) or improving the ship (to add gifts).

BURDENS & GIFTS FOR SHIPS  
The following options provide positive or negative properties for various ships. Some negative properties can be corrected by time and/or money, others are inherent to a craft & can't be changed.

Burdens  
The following negative properties can be used to represent issues with a ship:

**Damaged**: The ship's Speed & Range are reduced by half (round down). The repair cost is 10£ & a month of work.

**Encumbered** (applies if you have more passengers than allowed): The ship's Speed is reduced -1 for each additional person. The ship's Range decreases by -1 day for each 3 additional persons, round down. The ship has -DisAdv on maneuvers.

**Missing Crew** (applies automatically if you have half or less of your standard crew): The ship's Speed is reduced to half its normal value, round down. The Range increases by 1-half, round down (i.e. a ship with Range 3 has Range 4 with Missing Crew).

**Small**: This ship is small for its intended purpose (it's a Large object). Reduce the crew & passengers by half. Add half again to the Range. Round down in all cases. This burden is inherent & cannot be changed.

**Weakened**: This ship has been hurt in some way, but not enough to count as being properly damaged. The ship's Speed is reduced by 1 & it gains -DisAdv on maneuvers. You can remove this Burden by spending 5£ & 1 week in repairs.

Gifts
The following properties provide benefits for the ship. Each entry that can be added to an existing ship gives you cost & time requirements.

**Additional Benches**: You gain the room for 2 more Crew, allowing you to carry more Passengers but also requiring a higher minimum Crew (see the rules for Crew, above). Add 1£ to the monthly upkeep cost. You can take this Gift up to 3 times (6 if the ship is Large). Costs 3£ & 1 week of work.

**Deep Bite**: The ship has +Adv when making the Come To maneuver. This improvement involves lengthening the rudder & costs 5£ & 1 month of work.

**Musician**: Your crew improves their oar timing & efficiency. Costs 1£ & 1 week of training. The ship gains +1 Speed.

**Extra Stores**: The ship gains room for more supplies, increasing Range by 1 day. Spend 5£ once & add 1£ to the monthly upkeep. You can take this Gift up to 3 times (6x if the ship is Large).

**Large**: This ship is exceptionally wide or long & is a Gargantuan object. Such ships must be built with this gift inherent & will likely most the Hero 50£ or more if they must pay for its construction.

**Reinforced**: The ship has +Adv on CON saves. Costs 2£ & 2 weeks work.

**Rigging**: An expert sailor teaches you how to set your rigging for maximum effect. Costs 1£ & 1 week of training. The ship gains 1 Speed.

**Shield-rack**: An attacking ship has -DisAdv on any ranged attacks made against your crew. Costs 1£ & 1 weeks work.

**Trimmed Sails**: You've become an expert at positioning the sails to catch as much wind as possible. Costs 5£ & 1 month of training. The ship gains 1 Speed.

SHIP COMBAT  
During this age of the world, ships rarely do damage directly to another. Ships are expensive & it's the goal of any mannish Foes to capture the ship, not destroy it. Even monstrous sea beasts are much more interested in the edible crew & Followers, rather than the tough & indigestible ship.

**Maneuvering Speed**: This value is equal to 1/10 the ship's maximum Speed, rounded down. You'll use this value to make sudden changes during combat.

Beginning a Sea Battle  
A sea battle begins when the ships are within sight of each other. This could be miles away, or considerably closer in the fog-bound & rough seas of the North. If the Hero's ship is faster than the enemy, then they can outpace them & avoid the encounter if desired. Otherwise, when the ships are within ranged weapons' fire (i.e. 600ft. or so) it is time to roll for initiative, but using piloting knowledge instead of DEX.

Ship Maneuvers  
On each ship's turn, the ship has movement & an action. Also, on the same initiative count any non-crew can take an action and/or use their movement, such as using a ranged weapon, or making a horizontal jump onto an enemy ship, or extending a boarding plank or grappling line (see below).

Ship Movement  
Ships always move before taking any actions. A ship can be moving at any speed up to its maximum Speed. The ship 1st moves its current speed forward in the direction that it is facing. The pilot can then increase or decrease the ship's speed by its maneuvering speed (up to its maximum speed). It can also change its facing by 1 step (e.g. from travelling north-west to either north or west).

Ship Actions  
One of the following actions can be taken:

**All In**: The ship surges forward its Maneuvering Speed as the crew makes a desperate effort to gain a little more. _Note: this surge forward does not affect the ship's current speed as it is a temporary effect._

**Come To**: The ship changes its facing by 1 step or 2 steps if the Hero succeeds at a Pilot:15 check.

**Full Stop**: The ship's current speed is reduced by its Maneuvering Speed. Note that this is in addition to any reduction made during the movement step, so a ship can reduce its speed quite effectively by taking this action.

**Uncontrolled**: The ship makes no change during this turn. This action is required if the Hero uses their action this turn to do anything other than control the ship.

Boarding Actions  
When ships get close, within 30ft of each other, boarding actions can begin. The usual procedure is for some of the warriors to throw grappling lines in order to tie the ships together, then others cross over by leaping or using boarding planks. Each of these are an action, but once the character is on the other ship, combat can proceed as normal. The only difference might be that the setting of the combat is constrained & only a certain number of Followers are available

**Grappling Lines**: You can activate a Follower to hook the enemy ship with a rope & draw them together. The Follower must succeed at an Athletics:10 or Sleight-of-Hand:10 check. Once 3 lines are established, 1 Follower can Leap Across per round.

**Leap Across**: If the ships are tied together, you can activate a Follower to take the Leap Across action & automatically succeed. If the ships are not tied together but are within 10ft of each other then the Follower must succeed at a Athletics:10 or Acrobatics:10 check to make the leap.

**Boarding Plank**: If the ships are within 10ft of each other, you can activate a Follower to place a boarding plank between the 2 ships. Each plank placed allows 1 Follower to move to the other ship each round.

**Fighting Monsters**  
When sea monsters attack, they usually do so by surprising the ship & emerging from the depths directly underneath or next to the ship. A monster that is wholly in the water can only be targeted by ranged weapons. Monsters with tentacles or those who tend to climb on the ship can be fought with melee weapons. Otherwise you use the normal rules for combat & Followers.
Some monsters might target the ship directly, using AC 10 to damage it. When the ship has taken 20 points of damage, it gains the Weakened Burden. If it takes 40 points of damage then the Weakened Burden becomes Damaged instead. If the ship takes 80 dmg then it is destroyed & the crew, Followers & Hero must swim to safety. You can use the Rescue the Hero Follower ability to make sure that your Hero reaches the shore.

LOSING A SHIP  
It might chance that due to damage or other reasons that a ship is lost to the Hero. As mentioned earlier, a Hero always has the opportunity to acquire a new ship but, by default, that ship has none of the Gifts (and none of the Burdens) of the old ship. Additional crew are left behind since there are no benches for them, & the sailors must learn the new ship before any special training will take hold (meaning that you'll need to spend money & time again before acquiring those sorts of Gifts). The GM may or may not allow the Hero a choice of basic ship. A local ship owner will always take a chance on gifting a Hero a basic ship.  
If the Hero desires more than a basic ship as a replacement, then they face a problem. Powerful ships are not simply waiting to be bought at a ship-shop anywhere around the Whale Road. Vessels like these are powerful tools, built under the patronage of nobility, & anyone who owns 1 has a use for it. They cannot be simply bought.  
In order to acquire a ship with similar or identical upgrades to the 1 they lost, a Hero will need to return to their home hall, or occasionally a recent hall where they have won significant favor. They will need to arrive bearing suitably rich gifts, may need to make peace with their home ruler if necessary, & may well be asked to perform service for, or swear oaths to, that ruler. To replace a lost ship with 1 of similar upgrades will cost a minimum of 20-30£ in gifts, & should always come with adventure hooks, & opportunities to roleplay the relationships involved. The gifted ship will also be very likely to come with strings attached, & if the gift price is lower, then the services owed will be more costly.

HEROIC FEATS  
A feat represents a talent or an area of expertise that gives a character special capabilities. It embodies training, experience, & abilities beyond what a class provides.
At certain levels, your class gives a feat of your choice. You can take each feat only once, unless the feat's description says otherwise.
You must meet any prerequisite specified in a feat to take that feat. If you ever lose a feat's prerequisite, you can't use that feat until you regain the prerequisite.
For example, the Grappler feat requires you to have a STR1+. If your STR is reduced below 1 somehow -- perhaps by a withering curse -- you can't benefit from the Grappler feat until your STR is restored.

MORE THAN 1 PLAYER  
In BEOWULF: Age of Heroes we usually expect 1 Hero -- an exceptional individual who is accompanied by Followers that aid them but are rarely directly in the action. However, this doesn't always need to be the case. It is true that a lot of our inspiration draws on stories about a singular hero, but there are other stories about a team of exceptional people & you can use that model as well.  

BUILDING A GROUP  
If you choose to play BEOWULF with multiple players then your group will not have any Followers. Instead, the group should be able to accomplish together what a singular Hero & their Followers could by themselves. There are at least 3 different ways to build such a group:

- Use the Hero class as-is. (Best for small groups.) If you've been playing with your spouse or offspring & they want to show off to 1 of their friends then limiting the Followers to just a few per Hero & allowing a 2nd Hero works well.
- Use the Hero class but adjust the starting values. If there are 3 or more Heroes, each Hero starts with 8+CON HP instead of the higher starting amount. There are no Followers.
- Use outsider classes, using the core rules for character generation.

NO FOLLOWERS  
If you're playing with multiple Heroes (or other classes) & you don't have any Followers then when an adventure gives a Follower a burden or gift, a player character receives it instead. If a burden or gift requires you to become Spent, you instead gain +1 Exhaustion, & if a gift makes a Follower unspent you recover -1 Exhaustion instead. If a burden or gift indicates that the recipient would be killed, the character instead loses half (rounded down) of their current HD. If a burden indicates that a Follower cannot be activated, then choose 1 of the PC's features. That feature is no longer available to the character until they take a Long Rest.

BALANCE EXPECTATIONS  
Development has shown that a singular Hero with a full set of Followers is about equal in power to a group of 4 standard characters. This makes using CR & even non-BEOWULF adventures very easy.
If you have 2 Heroes with their extra starting HP & a few Followers this pattern will continue through the lower levels. But at higher levels you may wish to carefully judge the situation as it is easy for enemies with legendary & lair actions to outperform dual Heroes. If you have a regular sized party of Heroes (or other classes or a mix of core classes & Heroes) then you can continue to use CR & level suggestions. Of course, there is always the caveat that these tools are not perfect & can't anticipate your group's exact composition, tactical acumen, or environmental factors.

FOLLOWERS
Each Follower in the game has a name, any descriptive elements you care to add (like a physical description or personal history), & 1 or more gifts and/or burdens. These are recorded on a Follower Card. A blank card is provided on page 263. Collectively we call both gifts & burdens tags. Each tag provides some rules that allow (or require) a Follower to do something special, outside of the normal rules. But it also serves as a descriptor: sometimes an adventure might ask if any of your Followers are Bear-blooded, Prophetic or Guileless (Or more, there are many Burdens & Gifts.

The Follower Turn  
Outside of combat a Follower can be consulted to use a passive feature or activated to make use of a direct feature at any time. In combat, the Followers roll initiative as a group and, during their turn, can move & act as the Hero directs, perhaps activating a single Follower or a group of Followers depending on the action given.

Follower Checks, Saves, & Attacks  
For record-keeping simplicity, it is assumed that all Followers have +0 to all of their ability checks, Saves & attack rolls. Certain burdens & gifts might give them +Adv or -DisAdv on a roll but they never add or subtract anything from the d20 result.

Follower Damage  
Followers don't receive HP damage like enemies or the Hero. Ignore any such damage, only making death Saves when a Follower's burden or gift specifies. You can imagine that they have sufficient HP to face a monster, just like the Hero does.

Activating Followers  
A Follower is available if the Follower is in the same location as the Hero. An available Follower can be activated & the Hero can benefit from any passive benefits the Follower provides. Otherwise Followers fade into the background or are present at any location that it would be reasonable to find them. This means that many times the Followers are quietly accompanying the Hero, until they are needed.
Followers are activated to use 1 of their gifts or burdens. A Hero can activate a Follower on the Follower Turn & can also use their reaction to activate a Follower. This means in most normal cases up to 2 Followers can be activated in a combat round. However, some Follower tags cause all Followers with that tag to become active (for example 'Rescue the Hero' & 'Weapon-bearer'). This might allow many more Followers to be active, especially if it is an important fight.
A Follower might be killed or slain. The difference is that 'slain' represents a heroic death rather than just bad fortune, & can provide mechanical benefits.

Spending Followers  
Many times a Follower will become Spent, meaning they cannot be activated again until the Hero takes a Long Rest. When you activate a Follower's gift (or if the GM activates a burden) then the Follower may become Spent. A Spent Follower is no longer available -- they might return to the ship, be laid up in a bed at the longhouse, or otherwise gone. Sometimes they've just had their big narrative moment & might remain with the Hero, but they won't come back into the story in an important way.
It's important to note that not all gifts or burdens require a Follower to become Spent. Those that do will clearly specify when the Follower becomes Spent. Followers become unspent when a Hero takes a Long Rest.

What else can Followers do?  
For the most part, Followers are used solely via their gifts & burdens, but sometimes they have additional parts to play. An adventure may specify that a Follower can assist the Hero in swaying a NPC's opinion, or offer extra mechanical options to help the Hero resolve an encounter. Followers' tags may also be used as a hook for an additional mechanical effect.

Is Everyone A Follower?  
No. The crew of the Hero's ship & most of the background characters at a longhouse or other location are just regular NPCs & will not join the Hero on their dangerous missions in the way Followers do.

Non-human Followers  
A Hero may chance to meet an exceptional beast, known as a Noble Animal, who can serve as a Follower. Noble Animals can earn gifts & burdens like other Followers, but also have some that are only appropriate for them (see page 89). If a Noble Animal receives a gift or burden that doesn't make sense for them, swap it for 1 of their native ones. GMs might allow an adversary or even a Monster to serve as a Follower. In these unusual cases, the Follower can receive any gifts & burdens that it earns, but if a gift or burden does not make sense for that adversary then the GM will select an alternative one.

HOW MANY FOLLOWERS CAN A  
HERO HAVE?  
The number of Followers that a Hero can command is based on their fame, station & personality. Use the following formula to determine a Hero's current maximum Followers:

(2x Hero's ProfBonus)+CHA

If, for some reason, a Hero finds themselves with more Followers than they can command, they must release Followers (see page 88) at the earliest opportunity. Which Followers to release is always at the choice of the Player.

Neglected Followers  
If a Hero tries to keep more Followers than their maximum, when they had the chance to release them, all of their Followers gain the Malcontent burden. The Follower limit represents the Hero's ability to keep their Followers engaged & feeling useful. Both fame (ProfBonus) & personal magnetism (CHA) contribute, but every Hero has a limit to their retinue.  

**Malcontent**: This Follower is rarely happy with their lot in life. When activated, roll a d20. On a 1, they refuse to act.

FOLLOWER TYPES  
There are 3 kinds of Followers. _Simple Warriors_ begin with a fixed set of gifts that can be improved in the future. _Potential Followers_ are Followers with a set of customizable gifts that are ready to recruit. _Assistants_ are Followers that can help during the course of an adventure & can be recruited, if you fulfil certain, adventure-specific, requirements. They are built using the same system as Potential Followers.

MAKING NEW FOLLOWERS  
When you create a new Hero & a home longhouse, you will also want to create a number of Simple Warriors & Potential Followers that are available at that longhouse. This should be a collaboration between the Player & the GM, perhaps each of them creating half of the Followers, or taking turns selecting gifts & burdens.

Simple Warriors  
A Simple Warrior begins with 4 gifts: Engage, Rescue the Hero, Take a Blow & your choice of Weapon-bearer (Axe) or Weapon-bearer (Spear).

Choosing Gifts  
Each Potential Follower begins with Engage, either Rescue the Hero or Take a Blow, an optional alignment gift (Church-goer, Fence-sitter or Sky-minder), & up to 2 starting gifts (those marked with an asterisk). You can choose to add a burden for color or take a burden on in order to earn another gift (starting or regular). You should focus on creating a variety of Followers. After all, a simpler Potential Follower with limited skills will be less expensive to maintain over their lifetime. A highly able Follower will be more expensive, & probably more specialized. Once you've created a sufficient number of Potential Followers & Simple Warriors (perhaps a total =2x your maximum number of Followers) you can work with the Gamemaster to select starting Followers, up to your maximum. The Gamemaster might require a certain number to be Simple Warriors, to already have some Potential Followers pre-selected, or the 2 of you might take turns picking out who you feel will be most interesting for the adventure. Recruiting Potential Followers during character creation doesn't require any recruitment checks or cost, since they may be old friends of the Hero.

RECRUITING FOLLOWERS  
During the course of an adventure, the Hero will meet NPCs who may become Followers. These fall into 3 categories. Some will be _Simple Warriors_ who can be found at every longhouse in every land; others might be _Potential Followers_, put into the adventure for the purpose of being recruited, & who may well have some interesting gifts & burdens; others still will be _Assistants_, who are foreground NPCs who temporarily aid a character during the course of a story & might later join the Hero on a permanent basis.

A _Simple Warrior_ begins with 4 gifts: Engage, Rescue the Hero, Take a Blow & your choice of Weapon-bearer (Axe) or Weapon-bearer (Spear). As they accompany the Hero on future adventures they might acquire additional gifts & burdens, but for now they are very straightforward Followers. Recruiting Simple Warriors is automatic & they will initially join you for the fame & fortune that travelling with a Hero brings.

To recruit a _Potential Follower_, you must make them an initial offer of payment to secure their loyalty, which is equal to 10 shillings for each of their gifts. Their burdens do not affect the cost (like many people, Followers often have a poor sense of their strengths & weaknesses). If you offer 2x this amount or more, you have +Adv on the recruitment check.
To make the recruitment check, make a Persuade check where the DC=10+(Follower's number of Gifts). On a success, the Potential Follower agrees to come with you, becoming a regular Follower. If you fail the check, the Follower declines to join you, at least immediately.

_Assistants_ may be converted from temporary helpers to permanent Followers, but only if some special requirements are met. These requirements are given in the adventure where they appear.
You generally get a chance to recruit new Followers as part of the ending of an adventure, so that you are ready to begin your next adventure with your companions in place. Some adventures might allow you to recruit additional Assistants at the beginning or middle of the story. When you return to your longhouse, any Followers from your homeland might still be there to recruit. See Follower Journals starting on page 134 for more information about this.

Failwards with Followers  
A Follower rejecting the Hero's recruitment offer is a perfect opportunity for interesting roleplaying or assigning a secondary quest to an adventure. The NPC has some reason that they won't (or can't) join the Hero. This might be due to an old feud (that the Hero has to make amends for, with either words or treasure), an existing oath or obligation (perhaps the Hero can cause the oath/obligation to be released by performing some service), or a boastful nature that requires the Hero to prove their worthiness as a leader by taking some action or competing against the Follower.

Recruiting a Noble Animal  
Having a noble animal join your Followers requires something a little different. You don't pay noble animals to join you or even to remain with your crew. They join only if they judge you worthy & remain only as long as that judgement remains. To prove yourself worthy, make a Animal Handling check with the DC=13+(noble animal's number of Gifts). On a success, you gain the noble animal as a Follower. On a failure, you cannot have the noble animal yet. You cannot make another attempt until you chance across the noble animal again (having at least 1 adventure before that happens). A noble animal Follower starts with either Rescue the Hero or Take a Blow & 2 gifts (starting or regular) of your choice. You can select 1 burden for color or 1 burden to add an additional gift.

THE REWARD STAGE  
As an adventure ends, the local rulers might reward the Hero with treasure: silver & gold in many forms. But the Hero is not just a ring-winner, but also a ring-giver, because they in turn must reward their loyal crew & Followers.
This stage takes place at the end of the adventure, either before the Hero sets sail for their next destination or perhaps onboard the ship or at their home longhouse afterwards.

REWARDING CREW  
The crew's regular payment is part of the ship's maintenance cost (see page 75). If you decide to reward them for extraordinary service then a gift of 10-30 additional silver pennies (an average of 1 or 2 each) is acceptable.

RETAINING FOLLOWERS  
For each of your remaining Followers, you must pay 10 shillings for each of their gifts (their burdens do not affect this amount, except for the exceptions below). As long as you pay this amount & do not cause strife among your Followers, they will stay with the Hero & continue to adventure with them, at least until they believe they're ready to become Heroes themselves (see below).
While the required costs are given in shillings, treasure-items are often provided in terms of £-value. Remember 40 shillings is equivalent to 1£. Some small measure (perhaps 1-2£ worth) of a leader's reward will be given in coins, which will help keep things balanced. Followers tend to live in the moment & will not remember that you overpaid them last time if they are being shortchanged this time.
The following conditions can cause strife:
- If a Follower is paid much less than everyone else. A Follower that receives half the pay or less of the next least paid Follower gains the Envious & Sullen burdens.  
- If a Follower with more gifts gets less money than a Follower with fewer gifts. The Follower with more gifts gains the Unappreciated & Sullen burdens. A Follower with the Eager burden loses it if they become Unappreciated.  
- If you cannot afford to pay your Followers at all. Each unpaid Follower gains the Unappreciated & Sullen burdens temporarily. The burdens are removed as long as you pay the Follower after the next adventure.

**Envious**: When you pay this Follower you must either pay them 20 shillings for each of their gifts or you must make a Persuade:20 check to retain them. On a failure, the Follower leaves the Hero.

**Unappreciated**: After paying this Follower you must make a Persuade:10 check to retain the Follower. On a failure, the Follower departs.

**Sullen**: This Follower cannot be activated without also becoming Spent at the end of the activation. This tag is permanent, unless the Player chooses to remove it (see page 88).

SLAIN FOLLOWERS  
Over the course of the adventure, Followers might be slain by a Monster. This is different from being killed as the result of failing a death Save vs an environmental challenge or minor adversary. When a Follower is slain, it is because the Player has chosen for that Follower to make the ultimate sacrifice on behalf of the Hero.
Such a sacrifice is transformative for the Hero & they gain an XP bonus to represent the new wisdom & responsibility the Hero shoulders as they go forth without their friend.

XP bonus= 25×(Follower's # Gifts - Follower's # Burdens)×Hero's ProfBonus

The Hero receives the XP bonus & gains +1 Inspiration if they do not already have it. If you are using Achievement awards instead of XP, this event can count as an Achievement award.

DEAD FOLLOWERS  
The Hero fights Monsters & that sometimes means that Followers die. However, this is not ignored in the story -- villagers will ask after their fate, the crew will wonder what became of their friend, and, sooner or later, the Hero will have to inform the Follower's family of their fate. Also, those Followers who survived will tell their own tales. If the Hero's tale contradicts their own, then shadow will hang over the Hero's head.
If you are recruiting Followers after an adventure in which 3+ Followers were slain, or 2 or more Followers were killed, then you have -DisAdv on your recruitment checks.
The family of a dead Follower may demand wergild, at least 1lb of silver for each gift the Follower possessed. A Hero may make a Persuade:10 check to reduce this cost by the number of burdens the Follower possessed but speaking ill of the dead also causes -DisAdv on any other social rolls made in the same hall or village.
If the total number of dead Followers exceeds the Hero's Lv+ProfBonus then any current Followers gain the Untrusting burden, permanently.

**Untrusting**: This Follower doubts the good intentions of the Hero. In a dangerous situation, the Follower must succeed at a WIS:10 Save in order to be activated.

Further consequences of a callous approach to Followers may involve other penalties: kings may be reluctant to host the Hero, ship-builders might charge more for repairs or upgrades, spiritual Followers may have trouble connecting with nature or God, etc.

DEPARTING FOLLOWERS  
Followers accompany a Hero hoping to gain fame, fortune & expertise. When they are ready, they will step forward & take up the mantle of Hero for themselves, leaving the Hero's band. If 1 or more Followers have more than 7 gifts at the beginning of the Reward stage, then they will want to depart from the Hero & seek their own fortune.
If the Hero celebrates this & announces it to the assembled hall then the newly freed Follower has an auspicious beginning & the Hero is recognized for their wisdom. They gain an Advancement award or the level-appropriate amount of Meeting XP. See page 129 & on.
The Hero might instead try to convince the Follower to remain. This requires a Persuade check with the DC=10+(number of tags the Follower has). A Follower that agrees to stay will not attempt to depart again until they have received 2 more improvements or 2 years have passed, whichever comes first. A Follower kept in this way gains the Oath-bound burden.

**Oath-bound**: This Follower has promised the Hero to remain with them as opposed to seeking their own way. The burden remains until the Follower receives 2 improvements or 2 years pass, whichever comes first. The binding may attract unwanted attention from creatures that can sense the Follower is unhappy.

RELEASING FOLLOWERS  
A Hero may encounter characters that they are interested in recruiting, but they already have their maximum number of Followers. A Hero may also find themselves in unexpectedly reduced circumstances, & unable to command as many Followers as before. In such cases, the Hero must release 1 or more of their Followers.
The Player gets to pick which Followers leave when releasing Followers. They may do so at any credible opportunity during or after an adventure, when the released Follower can safely move on to other things. It is up to the GM to adjudicate if a Follower will accept being released at that moment. If the Hero's band find themselves at a busy longhouse, then a parting of the ways can easily occur. Deep in a subterranean cavern would be a less suitable place to abandon one's Followers, & they might sternly resist leaving.
The Player may want to work with the GM in order to create a pleasant release process. Perhaps the Follower has met someone over the course of the previous adventure that they have fallen in love with, or met someone they wish to study under, or have received word from their homeland that they must return. No matter what solution you develop, provided it is credible, the process of releasing a Follower is automatic & they move off the stage gracefully.

IMPROVING FOLLOWERS  
Followers can be improved. At the end of the adventure, the Player can make a choice between these actions.
- Transform a temporary gift into a permanent one.
- Give 1 Follower a new temporary gift.
- Make a burden temporary.

The Player can take a number of actions up to their ProfBonus, making their choice each time.

_Example: Cassandra is improving her Followers. Her Hero, Alys, is 5th level & thus has +3 ProfBonus. 1 of her Followers, Saewine, received Sign from Above as a temporary gift in the last adventure. Cassandra decides to make that gift permanent. For her 2nd choice, she decides that since the GM has been dropping hints about Gruni's Death-mark, she will make that burden temporary. She briefly considers using her 3rd choice to give a Follower a new gift but instead decides to make Thormund's Malcontent burden temporary as well._

Transforming a Gift  
If a Follower has a desirable gift that is temporary, you can use this action to improve that gift into a permanent one.

Giving a New Temporary Gift  
You can select a gift for 1 of your Followers to receive. It becomes a temporary gift that they will start the next adventure with. After the adventure, you will need to select the Transform action to make it permanent.

Making a Burden Temporary  
You can choose to make a permanent burden temporary. This is the only way (usually) to remove burdens from Followers. The burden still applies for the next adventure but is removed at the end of that adventure. Oftentimes the Gamemaster will add details to the Follower's story in order to help explain the easing of the burden.

Adding a Burden  
The Player can choose to add a burden to a Follower, in order to add another temporary gift to that same Follower. The burden counts as permanent, but can be made temporary at the next reward stage. You can only add 1 burden for each reward stage, no matter how many Followers you have.

Follower Journaling  
If the Player provides a detailed account of a Follower's story, they gain 1 additional action with which to make a mechanical change to represent the story. Even if a Player maintains journals for each Follower, you can only gain 1 additional action for each reward stage.

New Gifts  
The idea that a new gift is, at first, temporary allows the Player to experiment with the abilities of Followers. It is also a good rule to remember if the Gamemaster created a home-ruled gift that ends up being more (or less) powerful than expected. You can simply declare that the gift needs revision before making it permanent or you might outright forbid it in the worst cases. Try to do this sparingly. Hopefully the Player will understand -- a game is not very much fun if it's too easy or ridiculously hard.

Temporary Burdens & Gifts  
After you're finished with improving Followers, any remaining temporary gifts are removed from each of the Followers & any old temporary burdens go away as well. Burdens made temporary by the improvement process will last until the next reward stage.

FOLLOWER BURDENS & GIFTS  
The following is a list of burdens & gifts to use when creating & improving Followers. Some gifts that represent a Follower's background can be selected as extra starting gifts & don't count towards a Follower's initial number of gifts. Some gifts cannot be selected for a starting Follower, as they represent advanced training for that Follower.
Some burdens or gifts might cancel each other out. For example, if you have 2 gifts, 1 which gives the Follower +Adv on death Saves & 1 that gives that Follower -DisAdv on the same then they roll death saves as normal (neither +Adv or -DisAdv).

BURDENS  
The following burdens are available for starting Followers or might be received during play:

**Awkward**: -DisAdv on CHA checks.  

**Blind**: -DisAdv on ability checks that require seeing.  

**Clumsy**: -DisAdv on DEX checks.  

**Deaf**: -DisAdv on ability checks that require hearing.  

**Death-mark**: There's a price on this Follower's head -- somebody wants them dead.

**Dullard**: -DisAdv on INT checks.  

**Eager**: Provides +Adv on recruitment checks.  

**Envious**: When you pay this Follower you must either pay them 20 shillings for each of their gifts or you must make a Persuade:20 check to prevent them leaving.  

**Foolish**: -DisAdv on WIS checks.  

**Frail**: -DisAdv on STR checks.  

**Guileless**: -DisAdv on Deception checks.  

**Hobbled**: Moves at half normal movement speed.  

**Infirm**: -DisAdv on CON checks.  

**Malcontent**: This Follower is rarely happy with their lot in life. When activated, roll a d20. On a 1, they refuse to act.  

**Mute**: The Follower does not (or cannot) speak.

**Oath-bound**: This Follower has promised the Hero to remain with them as opposed to seeking their own way. The burden remains until the Follower receives 2 improvements or 2 years pass, whichever comes 1st. The binding may attract unwanted attention from creatures that can sense the Follower is unhappy.  

**Slow**: This Follower does not move as quickly as most Followers.  

**Sullen**: This Follower cannot be activated without also becoming Spent at the end of the activation. This tag is permanent, unless the Player chooses to remove it (see page 88).  

**Troubled**: This Follower has been bothered by the Hero's behavior. Before paying this Follower you must make a Persuade:10 check to prevent them leaving.  

**Unappreciated**: After paying this Follower you must make a Persuade:10 check to prevent them leaving.  

**Untrusting**: This Follower doubts the good intentions of the Hero. In a dangerous situation, the Follower must succeed at a WIS:10 Save in order to be activated.  

**Weakened**: -DisAdv on death saves.  

**Young**: The Follower is notably younger than most. When their age or inexperience would likely affect them, they have -DisAdv on INT & WIS checks.

GIFTS  
Gifts marked with an at@ are starting gifts (see page 85). Those marked with a dagger † are advanced gifts & cannot be chosen for a new Follower.

**Alert†**: If this Follower is present for a combat, roll initiative for the Followers with +Adv.

**Aggressive†**: This Follower has +Adv on all Attacks & -DisAdv on death saves. (Cannot be combined with the Defensive gift.)

**Animal Wisdom (Noble Animal only)**: This Follower can use their Reaction to add +1d6 to any skill check. The Follower must then make a CON:5 Save or become Spent.

**Baker@**: This Follower knows how to make bread & pastries. Spend this Follower in a location with appropriate supplies & equipment to feed a group of people.

**Battle-bred**: When the Hero takes damage from a successful attack, spend this Follower as a reaction. The Follower reduces the damage by half & must make a CON:10 Save or become Spent.

**Bear-blooded@**: This Follower has +Adv on STR checks & saves.

**Battle Axe**: Spend this Follower in combat. The Hero gains +Adv on all of their Attacks this turn & the Hero's target does not benefit from their shield (if they have one).

**Blessing of the Forest Lord (Old Ways only)**: Spend this Follower to grant the Hero +Adv on 1 ability check, attack roll or Save within the Dark Forest.  

**Brewer@**: The Follower is familiar with making ale or other fermented beverages. Activate them to gain +Adv on a check or Save to do with alcohol.  

**Church-goer@**: This Follower is aligned with The Church.  

**Climber@**: This Follower has a climb speed equal to its normal speed.  

**Combat Expert†**: This Follower has +Adv on the 1st attack roll of each combat.  

**Deadly Strike†**: This Follower can spend -1 Inspiration to turn a successful attack into a critical hit.

**Defensive†**: This Follower has -DisAdv on all Attacks &  
+Adv on death saves. (Cannot be combined with the Aggressive gift.)  

**Determination**: The 1st time this Follower would become Spent, they can make a WIS:10 Save. On a success, they remain unspent. This gift is temporary & is removed at the end of the adventure unless the Player chooses to convert it to a permanent gift (see page 88).

**Engage**: When you roll Initiative, each Follower with this gift can be assigned up to 2 opponents in a battle. Engaged opponents spend their turn fighting the Follower unless the Hero is within reach, in which case the opponent can attack the Hero as normal. On the 3rd & subsequent rounds, the Follower must make a death save at the end of the opponent's turn if they were the target of the opponent.

If a Follower was Engaged with an enemy they remain Engaged. A Follower with a gift that allows attacks may still use their turn to make an attack. As long as they are members of a shield wall, Followers do not need to make death saves, regardless of how long they have been Engaged. If there are 4+ members of the shieldwall then the Hero can use their action to expend a HD & recover HP (as if they were taking a Short Rest). If the Hero has a shield then they count towards the members of the shieldwall. The shieldwall remains up for a number of rounds equal to its members or until the Hero orders the shieldwall to disperse.

BEGINNING THE ADVENTURE
In BEOWULF: Age of Heroes a singular Hero & their Followers venture forth from a place of safety into dangerous circumstances. In that deadly place, they may meet people under threat, might seek for answers among those people or places & will certainly confront the danger, usually a Monster of some form, & seek to defeat it. If successful, the Hero will be richly rewarded & safety will be restored to the location. Then the Hero will hear news of another distant threat & set sail for adventure again
This is the pattern seen in the Beowulf poem & many contemporary, earlier, & later adventure stories. It’s the format that most adventures in BEOWULF the game will use. To take this standard approach & break it down, we have the following elements

- Preparation & Portent: The Hero learns of the danger & accepts the quest. They gain some hint as to what is to come.  
- Sail & Surf. The Hero & their Followers leave safety & voyage to danger.  
- longhouse & Mystery. The Hero arrives at their destination. They seek to learn more about it from the people & places they explore.  
- The Monster. Sooner or later the danger must be met head-on. If the Hero has not completed their investigation, this will likely end with the Monster temporarily victorious. Eventually, the Hero learns the necessary secrets & defeats the Monster. Or dies trying.  
- Rest & Rewards. If the Monster is defeated, there may be rewards at hand. A newly-freed people may be generous in their gifts or the Monster itself might have a hoard of stolen items. But the Hero must also be generous, providing Followers & crew with well-deserved rich

Each of the above entries has its own section & together they comprise the rules for playing BEOWULF: Age of Heroes

PREPARATION & PORTENT
Your Hero will seek out monsters that trouble the lands of other lords & will necessarily travel to reach these distant places. In BEOWULF, the voyage is an important transition moment, as the Hero leaves behind a familiar longhouse & calls upon strangers to offer their services.
By various means, the Hero hears of a distant place in need of their help. Struck by some monstrous curse, the local ring-giver has sent out a call for aid. & the Hero responds!
Word might reach the Hero in any number of ways: by desperate messenger, in the words of a song, in a story told at the heath-side, or in a petition from travelers from a distant, imperiled land.
Before undertaking a voyage, the Hero learns a Portent. These wise words provide a pool of Inspiration tokens, some for the Hero, some for their Followers & some for the Gamemaster.

THE PORTENT  
Not even a Hero plays the Whale Road without some sense of what the sea has in store for them. Before leaving, they will consult wise folk & look for oracles in the sky, the water & in their own hearts. As they set about preparing to embark, a Portent will make itself known to them. Whether it be a supernatural prophesy, a sign from their god, or simply the overhead song of a scop on the wind, an omen arises. The GM will decide how the Hero hears the Portent.
The generation of the poetic Portent sets up the Inspiration pool, as well as providing the GM with some randomly generated happenings for the imminent sea voyage. An ill-favored Portent may make the quest more difficult. Favorable omens delivered in the Portent may make life easier for the Hero.

For example:
_"Shrine Battle, Beaten High-born"_

The 4 parts here are "Shrine", "Battle", "Beaten", & "High-born".

Each part of the Portent is randomly generated, using tables of Adjectives & Nouns.

1ST HALF OF THE PORTENT
To generate the 1st part of the Portent, the Player rolls 1d4 & consults the following structure table.

| 1d4 | Portent Structure   |
| --- | ------------------- |
| 1   | Adjective Adjective |
| 2   | Adjective Noun      |
| 3   | Noun Adjective      |
| 4   | Noun Noun           |

This tells you which sort of table to roll on: for an “Adjective Adjective” result, roll up 2 adjectives to form the 1st part of the couplet. For the “Noun Adjective” result, roll once on a Noun table, & then once on an Adjective Table

Adjectives & Nouns Table
| -   | 1 Adjective(x)Noun   | 2  Adjective(x)Noun | 3  Adjective(x)Noun         | 4  Adjective(x)Noun     | 5  Adjective(x)Noun   | 6  Adjective(x)Noun |
| --- | -------------------- | ------------------- | --------------------------- | ----------------------- | --------------------- | ------------------- |
| 1   | forgotten(R)twilight | sorrowful(R)mere    | high(R)boast                | gale-whipped(R)hurt     | broad(B)war           | quick(G)bronze      |
| 2   | stern(R)frost        | greedy(R)funeral    | oath-bound(R)woe            | doomed(R)portent        | woven(B)clamour       | sharp(G)iron        |
| 3   | ruddy(R)night        | weathered(R)raven   | bloodied-red(R)cruelty      | mended(B)swordplay      | buried(B)battle       | bold(G)gold         |
| 4   | weary(R)fen          | tempered(B)brine    | beaten(B)shield-clash       | threaded(B)cacophony    | high-born(B)sword-arm | bear(G)silver       |
| 5   | grey-green(B)shrine  | timbered(B)waves    | battle-scarred(B)salt-water | close-sewn(B)battle-cry | eagle(G)talisman      | trusted(G)salmon    |
| 6   | red-gold(G)faith     | gallant(G)honor     | dazzling(G)ring             | glinting(G)god          | stout(G)amulet        | oaken(G)gods        |

To roll on an Adjective or Noun Table, roll 1d6 for the horizontal axis, & 1d6 for the vertical axis. Cross reference the result to give you a word or phrase.
The GM determines which specific noun or adjective table relate to the adventure. A selection are provided in this book for variety (see below & page 261). The GM may wish to make their own adventure-specific tables
Each part of the Portent you generate also determines where an Inspiration token is assigned. Each adjective or noun sits on a color. These colors show which pool gains 1 of the 4 Inspiration tokens. Add tokens to the appropriate pool:  

Red (R): GM/Monster Pool  
Blue (B): Follower Pool  
Green (G): Player Pool

_Example: Nina rolls 1d4 for the 1st half of her Portent. She rolls a 3, meaning the 1st word will be a Noun & the 2nd word will be an Adjective. She rolls 1d6 for the horizontal axis & 1d6 for the vertical axis of the Noun table. She rolls a 6 & a 3. This gives the result of “Gold”. & it’s on green, so she places +1 Inspiration token in the Follower Pool. Next she rolls an Adjective by swapping to an adjective table. Again, she rolls her 2 six-sided dice, with a result of 4 & 5. That gives the result “High-born”, on blue. She places +1 Inspiration token in the Follower Pool. The 1st half of her Portent is “Gold High-born”. She notes it down._

2ND HALF OF THE PORTENT  
Repeat the same process again for the 2nd half of the Portent: 
Roll 1d4 for the structure, & then make your 2d6 rolls on the appropriate Noun & Adjective Tables, & assign the Inspiration tokens as instructed.

_Example: Nina rolls her 1d4 again, getting a 1. The 2nd part of the Portent will be “Adjective Adjective”. She rolls her 2d6, getting 5 & 3. This gives the result “Buried” on blue. Another token goes into the Follower Pool. She rolls the 2nd adjective, this time getting 4 & 4. This gives “Threaded” also on Blue. Another token goes in the Follower Pool. The 2nd part of the Portent is “Buried Threaded”. The full Portent is “Gold High-born, Buried Threaded”. Very mysterious & portentous! The result for the Inspiration pools was 3 in the Follower Pool & 1 in the Player Pool. Not a bad Portent all in all! Her Hero’s Followers are likely to play a big part in the adventure, & she has a fall back point of Inspiration should she need 1 quickly. Luckily there was no aspect of ill Portent here, & the Gamemaster gains no tokens. The omens are good!_

MEANWHILE  
While the Player is rolling up & noting down the words of the Portent, the GM should also note down the numbers rolled, in order. These are used by the GM to determine which challenges happen during the Voyage, in the Sail & Swell part of the adventure.

PREPARING THE SHIP  
Almost all travel in BEOWULF is accomplished by sea, using sailing ships that are not too dissimilar to the popular image of a ‘Viking’ longship. The ships are open, with the crew, the Followers & the Hero all exposed to the elements for the most part. Some ships might be gifted with an enclosed tent area but most don’t have the room. Travel is cold & wet, full of adventure & bold action.

Readying the Ship  
The craft is loaded with ballast, stones that are each about a child’s head in size. This gives weight to the ship, causing it to ride lower in the water (without a proper keel the draft of the ship & the rudder are the only ways to allow the ship to sail at an angle to the prevailing winds). In the event of the ship capsizing, the stones will easily fall out, allowing the ship itself to remain afloat.
Above the ballast but below the floorboards, the supplies are laid in. Everything will get wet over the course of the voyage, so food & other perishables are carefully wrapped to minimize damage. If the ship has a sail then the mast is stood up in the keelson & supported by the mast-fish (both of these are made of wood & are removable blocks that lock in place) & ropes called stays (fore & aft) & shrouds (sides) are tied to keep the mast in place. The yard (the crossbeam that the sail attaches to) & the sail are kept unattached & furled until needed.
There are benches & oar-holes for the crew. Additional supplies can be lashed onto the deck, under the benches or along the inside edge of the ship. Shield-locks allow for the Followers & Hero to display their shields on the side of the ship. Keeping the shields in place during rough weather is not practical & thus the shields are only set out when wanting to make an impression whilst in a safe harbor or when arriving somewhere. The ship might have a figurehead or other symbol that represents the Hero & their family.
With the Portent ringing in their ears, the Hero, their Followers & Crew embark upon the Whale Road!

SAIL & SWELL: THE VOYAGE  
Your Hero will seek out monsters that trouble the lands of other lords & will necessarily travel to reach these distant places. In BEOWULF, the voyage is an important transition moment, as the Hero leaves behind a familiar longhouse. Voyages consist of a number of challenges, which are events along the way.

WHAT IS A VOYAGE?  
A voyage is a trip from 1 place (perhaps the Hero’s homeland, or their current location) to another, which begins the adventure. Before heading on a voyage, the Hero will consult the wise & learn predictions of what is to come. See Portents on page 97 for these rules. Travelling inside an adventure doesn’t use the Voyage rules. We just simply refer to these smaller journeys as trips or sailing to a new place, since they are not as extensive as the important Voyage that begins an adventure.

PURPOSE OF A VOYAGE  
The intent of the Voyage rules is to provide a short, summarized opening for the main body of the adventure. In the poem Beowulf, our Hero is so great a sailor & ship’s captain that no challenges cross his path at all. The Voyage serves to establish how the Hero arrived at the site of the adventure, & get everyone in the mood. Alongside the Portent it also provides some variation for the Hero’s arrival. A ill-fated voyage could see the Hero arrive in slightly less glorious condition than that in which they embarked!

ARE ALL VOYAGES ON THE WATER?  
In the world of BEOWULF, the kingdoms known to the Hero are small, bright dots of civilization, separated from each other & more dangerous unknown lands by the Whale Road -- the cold, unforgiving sea. Thus, whenever a character seeks out adventure, they almost always use a ship to reach their destination. It is possible that some monsters might lurk elsewhere, such as a mountaintop cave, or in the depths of a dark forest, but most every voyage begins & ends with a ship. If a Hero is returning to a land that they have already visited along a route that they have already used, then there is no need for any preparation. They can sail to the destination with no restrictions, & are considered to be sailing familiar waters. Otherwise, the Hero must prepare for a new Voyage. This is done in several steps:
- The GM has already recorded the numbers the Player rolled when creating the Portent.  
- Next, the length of the voyage must be considered. A short voyage requires less effort & contains fewer challenges than a longer one. There are 3 categories: Short (1 challenge, with 1 to 2 days of travelling time), Medium (2 challenges, from 2 to 4 days of travelling time) & Long (3 challenges, 5 or more days of travelling time).  
- After all challenges have been dealt with, the ship has reached its destination & the Hero is ready for the next step. If they are in the right place, that usually means a visit to the longhouse (see page 107

BUT WE DON’T HAVE FOLLOWERS  
If you’re playing with multiple Heroes (or other classes) & you don’t have any Followers then you can assign any burdens or gifts to a PC. If a burden or gift requires a Follower to become Spent, you instead gain +1 Exhaustion, & if a gift makes a Follower unspent you recover -1 Exhaustion instead. If a burden or gift indicates that the recipient would be killed, the character instead loses half (rounded down) of their current HD. If a burden indicates that a Follower cannot be activated, then choose 1 of the PC’s features or traits. That feature or trait is no longer available to the Player.

CHALLENGES  
Over the course of a voyage, the Hero & Followers will be challenged by the sea, the sky, the dangers of the world & perhaps by the discord they bring with them. For each challenge needed, use a set of the grid numbers from the Portent. The 1st number now indicates the Challenge Type & the 2nd number indicates the individual challenge.


| 1st Number Generated | Challenge Type |
| ---------------------- | -------------- |
| 1                      | Wyrd           |
| 2                      | Land           |
| 3                      | People         |
| 4                      | Sky            |
| 5                      | Wind           |
| 6                      | Water          |


| - | Wyrd                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| - | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1 | **Vigorous Debate**: Choose 2 Followers of different alignments. If all Followers are of the same alignment or none of your Followers have alignment gifts, treat this as Fellowship instead (below). Each selected Follower must make a INT:15 check. If both succeed, or both fail, nothing happens. If 1 Follower succeeds, the other Follower gains the Questioning Faith burden. **Questioning Faith**: If an effect targets this Follower because of their alignment, they receive -DisAdv on their Save. This burden is temporary & is removed at the end of the adventure. |
| 2 | **Conversion**: Choose a Follower with an alignment to preach & a target Follower with the Questioning Faith burden as the target. If no Follower has the burden, then treat this result as Fellowship instead. The preacher must make a INT:15 check. On a success the target Follower loses the Questioning Faith burden & their original alignment gift. The Follower gains the alignment gift of the preacher & becomes Spent.                                                                                                                                                              |
| 3 | **Fellowship**: Choose 2 Followers of the same alignment & have each roll a d20. The 1 with the higher result gains the True Believer gift. **True Believer**: If an effect targets this Follower because of their alignment, they receive +Adv on their Save. This gift is temporary & is removed at the end of the adventure unless the Player chooses to convert it to a permanent gift (see page 88).                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 4 | **Vision**: On a lonely watch sometime during the voyage, a Follower of your choice receives a vision. They gain the Fortunate gift. **Fortunate**: This Follower has been marked by fate. 1 time during the current adventure they may reroll the d20. This gift is removed once they use it. If they reach the end of the adventure & still have the gift, they lose it before the reward stage (see page 86).                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 5 | **Foreboding**: A dream comes to 1 of the Followers (determined randomly) & disturbs them deeply. The Follower gains the Despair burden. **Despair**: If this Follower fails a check they become Spent, even if they would not normally be Spent by the action. This burden is temporary & is removed at the end of the adventure.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 6 | **Resolution**: Choose 1 Follower. During the voyage, this Follower has strengthened their will to help the Hero. They gain the Resolve gift. **Determination**: The 1st time this Follower would become Spent, they can make a WIS:10 Save. On a success, they remain unspent. This gift is temporary & is removed at the end of the adventure unless the Player chooses to convert it to a permanent gift (see page 88).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |


| -   | Land |
| - | ---- |
| 1 | **Fantastic Animal**: 1 of your Followers has a chance to hunt an exceptional beast on an island along the way. If you choose to do so, they must make a DEX:15 check. On a success, the Follower is Spent but you gain the Well-fed gift. On a failure the Follower is not Spent & receives no gift. If the Follower chooses not to pursue the beast, the Follower instead receives the Blessing of the Forest Lord gift. **Well-fed**: The Follower with this gift is Spent. The Follower can remove this gift to counteract any challenge or event that involves hunger for the Hero or other Followers. This gift is temporary & removed at the end of the adventure. **Blessing of the Forest Lord**: The Follower can grant the Hero +Adv on 1 check within the Dark Forest. The Follower becomes Spent. This gift is temporary & is removed at the end of the adventure unless the Player chooses to make it permanent (page 88).     |
| 2 | **Excellent Campsite**: You have located a nearly perfect place to rest ashore overnight. Water & food are plentiful, & the Followers not on watch are able to get plenty of rest. Choose a Spent Follower & make them unspent but also give them the Spoiled burden. **Spoiled**: This Follower is convinced that they have already done enough to serve the Hero. In order to activate them, the Follower must make a WIS:10 Save. On a failure, the Follower does not activate but remains unspent. The reaction is wasted. This burden is temporary & is removed at the end of the adventure.     |
| 3 | **Visiting Peddler**: 1 of the locals decides to take advantage of your presence on the shore as you pull in for the rest or water, & sells something to 1 of your Followers. Roll 1d20: on a 1-10 the Follower gains the Wasted Money burden, on 11-20 they gain the Useful Knick-knack gift. **Wasted Money**: If you give this Follower a reward before the end of this adventure, its value counts as halved for determining its effectiveness. This burden is temporary & removed at the end of the adventure. **Useful Knick-knack**: During any scene with a NPC (not the Monster) you can activate this Follower & remove this gift in order to gain +Adv on an ability check. The Follower does not become Spent. This gift is temporary & is removed at the end of the adventure (if not before).     |
| 4 | **Rough Landing**: It is difficult to find a safe place to pull the ship ashore here, & several of the crew & your Followers must get into the dark, cold water in order to navigate it up onto the beach. Choose 2 Followers, each must make a CON:10 Save. On a failure, the Follower receives the Wounded burden. **Wounded**: If this Follower is required to make a death Save, they automatically fail. This burden is temporary & if the Follower survives the adventure you may remove this burden at the end.     |
| 5 | **Stormfront**: The weather turns ugly & it's impossible to set sail. The Hero & the crew must take shelter. The long hours & cramped space set the crew at ill-ease. The Hero must make a CHA:10 save, or 1 Follower (player's choice) gains the Storm-touched burden. **Storm-touched**: This Follower is withdrawn & moody. In order to be Spent, the Hero must 1st spend -1 Inspiration in order to encourage the Follower to act. This burden is temporary.     |
| 6 | **Cove**: While searching for a landing site, the crew found what seems to be a perfectly sheltered place to land the ship. Such a location might have attracted other attention however: Roll a d6, on a 1 it's the home-base of a pirate crew (Bandits, page 202). You may spend a Follower in order to have your ship escape, otherwise the GM will improvise an encounter.     |


| - | People |
| - | ---- |
| 1 | **Disease**: Some illness is spreading amidst your crew. Choose 2 Followers. Each must make a CON:10 Save or gain the Sickness burden. **Sickness**: This Follower makes all checks with -DisAdv. If the Follower succeeds at a check anyways they may remove this burden. Otherwise this burden is temporary & is removed at the end of the adventure. |
| 2 | **Bandits**: Your camp has been noticed by rovers, who come to attack in the night. You can choose to play out the combat or you can spend a Follower in order to rouse the camp in time to easily drive them away. _Use the stats on page 202 for the bandits. There are as many bandits as the Hero has levels._ |
| 3 | **Disagreements**: A series of arguments divides your crew, & puts everyone in a foul mood. Starting with a Follower of your choice, have each Follower make an Insight:5 check, stopping when a Follower fails the check, or you have rolled for all of your Followers. If a Follower fails, that Follower receives the Sullen burden. **Sullen**: This Follower cannot be activated without also becoming Spent at the end of the activation. This tag is permanent, unless the Player chooses to remove it (see page 88). |
| 4 | **Overboard**: By accident, a Follower has gone overboard. You must either spend another Follower to rescue the 1st Follower (who also becomes Spent because of the fatigue incurred) or consign the 1st Follower to death. The GM can choose to have the Follower survive, & receive the Vengeance burden. **Vengeance**: Abandoned by the Hero, this Follower will make a future appearance in an adventure (this 1 or a future 1). Spend the Follower to impose -DisAdv on all of the Hero’s attack rolls until the end of their next turn & make an attack roll, doing 1d8 slashing damage if successful. |
| 5 | **Abandoned Vessel**: Your ship has come across the remains of an abandoned vessel. It could be anything from a capsized fisherfolk’s boat to a complete warship, empty & crewless, floating in the fog. Brave folks might wish to investigate the find, but the creepiness has a way of sticking in your mind. Choose 3 Followers, each must make a CHA:10 check. On a failure, they gain the Unnerved burden. **Unnerved**: This Follower has -DisAdv on saves vs Frightened. This burden is temporary & is removed at the end of the adventure. |
| 6 | **Pirates**: Such a rich ship as the Hero’s cannot help but attract some attention, but of late it has gathered the worst kind. Plunderers move to attack the ship, hoping to steal it & the prizes won by the Hero & their Followers. In the coming battle, choose 2 Followers. Each must make a death Save. If they fail, it counts as a heroic death. If both fail, the ship gains the Damaged burden. **Damaged**: The ship’s Speed & Range are reduced by half (rounding down). The ship must be repaired, see page 75. |


| - | Sky |
| - | ---- |
| 1 | **Clearest Skies**: There is not a cloud to be seen in the pale blue sky for the entire voyage. Instead the blazing sun always seems to be shining, reflecting brightly off the waves & even every metal fitting of the ship & the Hero’s armor. Choose a single Follower. They must make a CON:10 Save or gain the Sunstroke burden. **Sunstroke**: This Follower has been deeply affected by their exposure to the elements. When activated they must make a CON:5 check. On a failure they cannot be activated & become Spent instead. This burden is temporary & is removed at the end of the adventure. |
| 2 | **Cold & Unfamiliar Stars**: The night sky is amazingly clear & the stars are out in force. But something in their placement concerns the crew & those Followers who are well acquainted with the sea; the ship is off course. Choose a Follower, they must make a INT:13 check or become Spent as they spend all night working out a new course so that the Hero can reach their destination. _Note: As an alternative, instead of the Follower becoming Spent, the ship might be too far off course. In which case, the ship must make for whatever territory is at hand & might well encounter a different adventure than the 1 they set out on._ |
| 3 | **Witch’s Aurora**: The dark skies crackle with eldritch energy & eerie lights dance on the horizon. If the witches are bold, then even the ship itself is lit & sailors’ hair stands on end & they can feel the cold eyes of the sorcerers on the back of their head. Choose a Follower to make a WIS:10 Save, gaining the Witch-touched burden on a failure. **Witch-touched**: This Follower is convinced that they have certain obligations to fulfill before acting on behalf of the Hero. When this Hero is activated, they do not act or become Spent until the next round. |
| 4 | **Sky-rock**: Bright streaks race across the sky, & 1 comes entirely too close to 1 of your Followers on the prow of the ship. Choose a Follower to make a DEX:5 Save. On a failure, the Follower is struck by a meteorite & slain instantly. On a success, the Follower receives the Sign from Above gift. **Sign from Above**: This Follower has recently been marked by a near-death experience that they survived. Until the end of the adventure, they have +Adv on Saves. This gift is temporary & is removed at the end of the adventure. |
| 5 | **Lightning**: The storm rages & the sky flashes. Lightning races from cloud to cloud, & it is said that sometimes the wise can see the desires of the Heavens in its forms, if they are brave enough. You can choose 1 Follower to try & interpret the storms. They must make a INT:15 check, on a success they gain the Pattern of Heaven gift. On a Nat1, they are struck by an errant lightning bolt & slain. **Pattern of Heaven**: At a certain point in the adventure, a powerful sense of foreboding will take this Follower. You can activate the Follower to change 1 result on a d20 to any result (1-20) you want. The new value counts as the natural roll of the die. This gift is temporary & is removed at the end of the adventure unless the Player chooses to make it permanent (see page 88). |
| 6 | **Dragon-flight**: There are dragons high in the sky today, & while the Hero might welcome the challenge, most of the crew would rather escape the attention of the monsters. The dragons remain high in the sky & there are those who consider such a sighting a mark of good fortune. Choose 1 Follower to receive the Dragon-luck burden. **Dragon-luck**: If this Follower fails a Save, they can reroll it. If they do so, a powerful greed develops in their heart & any reward they receive counts as only half its value. |


| - | Wind |
| - | ---- |
| 1 | **Crosswind**: A powerful wind blows in a contrary direction, & only an expert sailor can get any use of such a wind. Choose a Follower to make a INT:10 check. On a failure, choose 3 other Followers to become Spent as they must row the ship for long hours against the wind. |
| 2 | **Doldrums**: There is no wind at all, neither for nor against the ship. Choose 2 Followers, each must make a STR:10 check, becoming Spent on a failure. |
| 3 | **Storm**: Rain lashes down & the wind howls. The sail must be furled & the ship is tossed without any clear sense of direction. Choose a Follower to make a STR:10 check; on a failure they become Spent, on a natural 1 the ship gains the Damaged burden. **Damaged**: The ship’s Speed & Range are reduced by half (rounding down). The ship must be repaired, see page 75. |
| 4 | **Freezing Cold**: Even though the crew is used to sailing in extraordinary conditions, the cold of the far north can be deadly. Choose 3 Followers to make CON:10 Saves. They receive the Shivering burden on a failure. **Shivering**: No matter what efforts this Follower takes, they cannot seem to become warm. They have -DisAdv on all checks until the end of the adventure, when this burden is removed. |
| 5 | **Fog**: A thick fog surrounds the ship, making it hard to know how much progress has been made. The cold fog saps the energy of the crew. Select 3 Followers, each must make a CON:10 Save. On a failure, they gain the Enervated burden. **Enervated**: This Follower has -DisAdv on attack rolls. This burden is temporary & is removed at the end of the adventure. |
| 6 | **Strong Winds**: The winds are with the Hero’s ship & it speeds across the waves. You bypass 1 challenge if any remain. So fast does it go, it is hard to steer & difficult to beach. When the ship reaches its destination, you must choose a Follower to make a Pilot:15 check. On a failure the ship is Damaged by the landing. **Damaged**: The ship’s Speed & Range are reduced by half (rounding down). The ship must be repaired, see page 75. |


| - | Water |
| - | ---- |
| 1 | **Shoals & Reefs**: The ship must travel narrow straits in a precise manner to avoid being damaged. A Follower must make a Pilot:10 check to steer the ship, with the ship receiving the Damaged burden on a failure. **Damaged**: The ship’s Speed & Range are reduced by half (rounding down). The ship must be repaired, see page 75. |
| 2 | **Visitors from the Deep**: Creatures from the deepest parts of the ocean sometimes find themselves near the surface, carried there by a storm or other turbulence. At night, a strange luminescence might surround the ship, or the crew might catch sight of ocean giants much larger than their ship. Choose a Follower to serve as lookout, if they succeed at a Perception:15 check then they gain the Nature’s Wonders gift. **Nature’s Wonders**: This Follower has recently been inspired by the beauty & majesty of the world. The 1st time you activate them to help you with a natural problem (i.e. 1 not dealing with men or monsters) they do not become Spent. This gift is temporary & is removed at the end of the adventure unless the Player chooses to make it permanent (page 88). |
| 3 | **Perfectly Still**: The water is as smooth as glass & no breeze troubles the sea at all. Looking over the sides of the ship, you can see the shapes of various fish & other sea creatures swim by. Only oars will do now, & the crew is hard-pressed. Select 2 Followers, each must make a CON:10 check. They become Spent on a failure. |
| 4 | **Rough Waters**: The sea swells & shifts around the Hero’s ship. The water crests over the bulwarks & threatens to swamp the crew. The Hero must hold the tiller straight & keep the ship on course. A Follower can make a STR:10 check to assist. On a failure, the ship is Damaged. **Damaged**: The ship’s Speed & Range are reduced by half (round down). The ship must be repaired, see page 75. |
| 5 | **Giant’s Stones**: A mischievous giant has hurled several large boulders near the water’s edge & the ship must be carefully steered between them. Choose a Follower to go to the prow & call out directions to the Hero. That Follower must make a Perception:15 check or the ship scrapes against a rock, Weakening it. **Weakened**: The ship has been hurt in some way, but not enough to count as being properly damaged. The ship’s Speed is reduced by -1 & it has -DisAdv on maneuvers. The ship must be repaired, see page 75. |
| 6 | **Sea-monster**: Some creature from the deep attacks the ship. If you like, you can play this out as a combat. Otherwise, choose 2 Followers. Each Follower must make a death save. A Follower that succeeds gains the Resolute gift. **Resolute**: The 1st time that this Follower would become Spent, the Follower can instead spend -1 from the Follower Inspiration Pool & remain unspent. This gift is temporary & is removed at the end of the adventure unless the Player chooses to make it permanent (page 88). |

USING CHALLENGES  
The challenges found in these tables are the starting point for your Voyages. When running the game be sure to include them as part of a wider description of the time spent at sea. Also take some time to flesh out the challenge, & feel free to interpret & alter its description.  
The aim of these mechanical rules is to set up how the Hero arrives at the main part of the adventure, & to give them something of a tale to tell when they arrive. It also helps Gamemaster keep travel at sea fresh & interesting. But they’re intended as a framework & a tool, not the whole story! Be sure to weave them into the adventure along with some evocative description of things the Hero sees from the rail, the conditions at sea, & some role-play with the Hero’s crew & Followers. Is is of course entirely possible to add your own encounters at sea, & any adventure might include elements that are written beforehand, seamlessly interwoven into the mechanically created Voyage challenges.

longhouse & MYSTERY
The Hero has set sail for adventure & mastered the challenges of the Whale Road. Now, their destination draws close. This section is largely for the Gamemaster, & if you’re a Player, you may wish to allow some mystery to remain, & stop reading now.
As you create adventures for the Hero, you’ll want to set a variety of challenges in front of them. Some of your adventures might be quite straightforward -- the Monster is out there (in some wild place) but comes to civilization at regular times to kill or terrorize the people. All the Hero needs to do is find out when & where, & then confront the creature. But usually it’ll be trickier than that. Like Grendel’s immunity to weapons, the Monster might well have some secret that 1st must be discovered & understood in order to defeat it: Monsters are impossible for ordinary people to kill, & that’s why they need a Hero. A Hero is by definition one who performs the impossible.
Monsters are often intrinsically linked to the places they trouble. Grendel is angered to murderous rage by the music & merry-making at Heorot. Without the raising of such a wondrous hall, the Monster Grendel would never have struck. The specifics of the community cursed by the visits of a Monster are worthy of investigation by the Hero to discover the underlying story.
This 2nd act of the adventure forms a bridge between the Hero’s arrival, & the final confrontation with the Monster. The Hero will be seeking to introduce themselves to the community, & then find out all that they can about the Monster. Some special rules additions & an established framework for every BEOWULF: Age of Heroes adventure are designed to structure that path.

USING THIS CHAPTER  
Unlike earlier sections, where there are clear rules for generating Heroes, portents, challenges, Followers & the like, these sections concern themselves with building an adventure. Therefore they are full of suggestions & inspirations, which by their very nature will not all be compatible with each other. As you read through, look for ideas that appeal to you & choose 1 or 2 of them to build an adventure around. The rest of the material can wait for another time & another adventure. Don’t feel like you have to include every idea that appeals, the Player doesn’t have the benefit of seeing what you’re planning & might get overwhelmed if there are too many plot threads.

LANDING
When Beowulf 1st arrives in Denmark, he & his crew are challenged by a shore guard. That there are guards assigned to watch the seas & beaches for approaching ships is 1 of the 1st signs that despite the terror of Grendel, Hrothgar is still a capable & wise leader. In your tales, the 1st sights & sounds of the afflicted land can set expectations for the rest of the adventure.

FIRST SIGHTS  
Describing the appearance of the destination as it comes into view will provide the Player the very 1st clues as to the nature of the land.
What kind of land is it? & what evil troubles it? From the moment of arrival, the Hero will be seeking to understand these mysteries & as Gamemaster you have powerful tools you can use to set expectations. For example, a Hero that arrives at a busy & cheerful port full of merchants must suspect that the evil of the land is hidden & secret. However, if the ship lands at a desolate strand of beach, & there is not even a shore warden there to greet them, then they know that the evil here may be less discreet.
Tall cliffs tell the Player that this place is cut off from the outside world & contains dangers, while a wide & sandy beach is a welcome sight but also means that others may come. It might even hint that the danger comes from the sea.
A low island with little vegetation or habitation is a place where things cannot be easily hidden. A bustling settlement with actual quays & docks speaks of rich commerce but also many dealings, some of which might be questionable or even evil. A village surrounded by dark forest lands or perched halfway up a mountain is isolated, set apart from all the others & more vulnerable for it.
In the heroic world of the Whale Road, the weather is always portentous. A glum overcast land, flung far from the main trade routes might molder under constant rain. A mysterious & fey place might endure under a constant blanket of sea-fog.
Make some notes about what the Hero & the crew are likely to see, hear & maybe even smell as they approach their destination, making sure that it provides hints to the Player about what is to come.

GUARDING THE SHIP  
A ship is a valuable thing and, while it is a conceit of the game that a Hero can always get ahold of a ship somehow, once the Player has invested time into a ship they will probably not want to lose it. This will often mean setting a guard on the ship, which could be the crew, 1 or more Followers (possibly including the crew), or in the strangest circumstances the Hero themselves (if, for example, the Monster was known to haul themselves up out of the sea on moonless nights & attack ships then the Hero would be the perfect choice). It is also possible that a wise & benevolent leader will offer the services of their folk to guard the ship. This might be a welcome offer, or if the leader is a wolf in sheep’s clothing, a nasty trick to make sure that the Hero has no means of escape available.
You can threaten the crew of the Hero’s ship in order to establish the danger of the Monster (or other enemies) but be careful -- you don’t want to overuse this technique, especially since the Hero gets the crew & ship for free. Similarly, Followers who guard the ship might be in danger, but the Player might well want to use their gifts to keep the Follower alive or strike out at the danger. This can be fine, if you want to create a ‘cut-scene’ where the Follower acts on their own initiative to deal with a problem, but you’ll want to keep the focus primarily on the Hero & not the Follower. Remember, however, the Player might become upset if their favorite Followers are slain without any recourse.

LOOKOUTS  
A well-established beach-head or port will have lookouts stationed by the local leader. It is often their responsibility to challenge any visitors & determine if they are friend or foe. This can cause some tense & exciting moments, if you & the Player are interested in roleplaying things out. It may be that you’ll allow the Hero to quickly identify themselves & be taken to the local longhouse immediately, but when a land is under threat the guards are more likely to question everyone closely.
Most of the time the Hero will be able to establish themselves in relationship to the leader, in the same way that Hrothgar knew Ecgtheow, Beowulf ’s father. Other Heroes might rely on their own leader having good relations with the land’s leader or their own personal reputation.
If the lookouts take responsibility for the Hero’s ship then they too might come under threat of the Monster.

OTHER APPROACHES  
Most adventures begin with a sea voyage. During the Migration Period, ships were the easiest & most common way of reaching new lands, & often the interior of those lands remained unknown -- dark, primordial forests & steep, cloud-covered mountains. Sometimes, however, a Hero might be called to these areas by news of a Monster haunting the in-land areas.
In these cases, you will want to adapt the challenges to the overland travel or simply prepare a number of custom challenges (and quite possibly a custom Portent) that fits the themes of the adventure. Like other exceptions to the rule, don’t feature this too often -- the Heroes are walkers of the whale-roads, not forest delvers or mountain climbers.

MEETING
The Hero will eventually make their way from their point of landfall to the community who have sent out the call for help. For ease of reference we call this ‘the longhouse’, but there are plenty of instances where the central site of an adventure is not a literal longhouse. There’s more detail on different kinds of longhouses in “Other Meeting Locations” on page 11.
There are strong reasons for why the Hero will almost inevitably immediately head to the local longhouse. In the lands around the Whale Road, this is customary -- when arriving in a strange kingdom bearing arms, it is only honorable to make oneself known, state one’s name & present your intentions. The local community leader is always keen to know who is about in their lands. The Hero is engaged in responding to a call for aid, & the longhouse is the place to present oneself as a Hero ready to help, & to find out more. BEOWULF: Age of Heroes assumes a certain level of genuine goodwill on the part of Heroes.
Beowulf ’s world is centered upon the longhouse. It is where both Grendel & his mother choose to make their attacks, sowing fear & doubt into Hrothgar & his forces. It is not a coincidence
that Beowulf also heads to Heorot as soon as he arrives, to present himself to Hrothgar & make his claim to defend the hall against Grendel. When he leaves Denmark, he sails back to his own lord Hygelac & meets with him in the king’s hall.
On arrival at the longhouse, the journey to action is complete, the 1st act is over, & so begins the second. As part of the deliberate structure of a Beowulf scenario, the longhouse is where the Hero begins to uncover the secrets of the Monster, by engaging the local community.
By using their skills, abilities & Followers, the Hero can find out a little bit more about the situation, & how to resolve it. This might include “unlocking” side-quests that reveal extra information, introductions to other NPCs, or clues. Just how long & involved the discovery of information about the Monster needs to be is entirely up to the Gamemaster.
A wise GM will take into account the kind of Hero their Player has chosen, & figure that into their scenario. & a good BEOWULF scenario will allow a range of approaches to the mystery. It is just as worthy to flex one’s heroic martial prowess as it is to carry out a careful, monk-like investigation.
Most often the heart of the situation is that a monster is causing strife, & must be slain, defeated or driven off. Within the community at the longhouse are found sufficient opportunities to unravel the riddle of what the beast is, where it can be found, & just how to defeat it.
There are of course a wealth of different options in how the Monster at the center of a scenario might be tracked down & defeated. A central part of that is interaction with NPCs in the longhouse.
Some NPCs will have information to uncover by impressing or befriending them with social skills, or perhaps a test of wits. Another NPC might want to wrestle the Hero in a test of strength. Others might offer the chance to find out more by undertaking a task somewhere else before returning to the longhouse. Sometimes that might even end the 2nd act & progress the plot, opening 1 door while closing others. It depends on the particular adventure.
To make longhouse social encounters extra interesting, some, many, or even all of the foreground NPCs at a longhouse can be interconnected, & the order & manner in which they are approached might be important. Success with 1 NPC might mean harder success with their rival. Or easier success with their friend.
For your initial adventures keeping things simple is a good idea. As you get used to the setting & the rules you can add in greater levels of complexity between NPCs.

SOCIAL STAT BLOCKS  
At the heart of most longhouses in BEOWULF are a network of characters for the Hero to meet & special social stat blocks for those NPCs. These offer criteria for having +Adv & -DisAdv in the exchange. They set the stakes for the conversation. Each important, or “foreground” NPC has the following stat block.

**Name**: The character’s name(s). Note that a character’s name can be the Player’s 1st hint at their culture & upbringing.

**Description**: This includes not only physical details about the person, but also their manner.

**Challenge**: This section gives a summary of what the Hero needs to overcome to win this NPC’s help. This entry includes 1 or more ability checks that the Hero can attempt to learn more from the character.

**Advantage criteria**: Careful observation & deduction can often allow a Hero to realize a way to improve their chances with an NPC. This section will list something that the Hero can do to improve the situation. Interactions with other NPCs may well affect any relationship with the Hero.

**Disadvantage criteria**: Similarly, a NPC might have specific things they do not like to hear, or ways in which they resist being treated. The NPC might suffer biases or prejudices that mechanically affect their interactions. This criteria may well include behavior towards other NPCs within the community. If a Hero approaches a character & enacts the behaviors listed under disadvantage criteria, or the NPC witnesses the Hero displaying this behavior to others, they will struggle to win the NPC’s favor.

**Follower hook**: There might be times that the presence of a specific Follower can influence the NPC’s attitude. A Follower hook gives the criteria for a Follower to become involved in a social encounter with this NPC.

Once the Hero approaches the character & accounts for all of the above options, they can make a check, according to the challenge listed above. The dice results are compared to the chart below:  
- **Success by 5+**: This should represent a complete success, with possible additional rewards. If this success level does not make sense, it is not necessary to include it.
- **Success**: This is a basic success, the Hero has made a connection with the character & will learn something useful from them. Success might open up a side quest or useful piece of information. It might provide advantage in an interaction with another NPC present.
- **Failure**: The Hero has failed at making a connection with the character. This person may become standoffish & won’t give up their best information. They may well attempt to absent themselves from conversation, or provide mildly misleading or unhelpful information.
- **Failure by 5+**: This represents an unusually terrible failure. The Hero has offended the character & hurt their future chances somehow. This level of failure does not need to be included in situations where it would not make sense.

**Further challenges**: Some characters will have additional information or tasks for the Hero. Each of these should be listed here. Keep additional challenges simpler than the primary one, as the Player has already succeeded with the character to reach this stage.

**Recruitment**: Some characters can be recruited as temporary Assistants. If so, this section should indicate how they can be convinced to join the Hero & provide their Follower statistics. Assistants can provide additional temporary help to the Hero, as well as adventure specific help that the Hero’s band might not be able to achieve alone. They’re also useful to make up the numbers, should the Hero’s Followers meet a grisly end.

FAILWARDS  
An important feature of BEOWULF is the idea of “failwards” -- rewards for failing. Social checks in the longhouse should never result in rolling the dice to make nothing happen.
A failed challenge in the longhouse will change the way the NPCs relate to the Hero & indeed each other. It will create a different story, & probably 1 that is less generous to the Hero. But a failed check should never create dead ends. It should simply open a different door -- it could provide a longer or more difficult route to the same conclusion as success, or unlock a different outcome entirely. Sometimes there’s more to see by going the long way round. The Player should not be afraid of failing: this is especially important in a duet game. The Player does not have a group of allies in the shape of the other players with whom to commiserate failure. If they are punished for failing a check, they can be forgiven for getting despondent & uninterested in the game a lot faster than when part of a multiplayer adventure.

CLUES, INFORMATION, SIDE QUESTS & MORE  
What kind of information or help might a Hero expect to discover from overcoming successful social challenges? Layering these kinds of rewards together can help you frame the planning of a scenario.
At a very basic level, these are the facts the Hero is looking for:  
- Where the monster lives  
- What its strengths are  
- What its weaknesses are  
- How to defeat it

A simple adventure will place a series of skill checks in-between the Hero & this information. In addition to skill checks clothed in the form of an NPC, with their own social needs to be met, skill checks might be found in the form of a location which involves a series of skill checks -- a high cliff that must be climbed for example. Or they might be a combination of many such checks, layering up to a complex, multi-pathed story that can be replayed many times with many outcomes.
An interesting adventure will make the path to this information a winding 1 with great views along the way.The basic information of how to find & defeat a Monster can be broken down, & spread amongst NPCs & locations around the adventure locale.

What an NPC might want from a Hero:  
- Reassurance, friendship, respect,  
- To make their enemies look bad  
- To make their friends look good  
- Material reward  
- Material help  
- A promise of future help or reward  
- Assistance in furthering their goals or aims

These things might involve simple social challenges, like a single successful CHA check, or involved side quests, like accompanying a carpenter deep into the forest to gather timber when no 1 else will go, which results in battling the outlaws that live there. Victory over the outlaws might in turn open up new skill checks at the longhouse.
An NPC might need several criteria of different kinds to be met. The Hero, for example, may need to impress a 2nd NPC, in order to discover that a precious object has been lost, discover its location, retrieve it at some peril, & then return it to its owner, the 1st NPC, & thereby unlock a vital piece of information.
This list provides some inspiration for types of information that an NPC or location might hold. Any of which might be incorrect or misleading:  
- Useful information about another character  
- An introduction to another character  
- The location of another character  
- Awareness of a place  
- The location of a place  
- Additional information about a place  
- Awareness of an event  
- The location of an event  
- Additional information about an event  
- Awareness of a thing  
- The location of a thing  
- Additional information about a thing  
- A thing itself

Remember that a character might have their own motivations, their own hierarchy of needs, & rank information in their own way. To them, the name of their neighbor’s horse might be the funniest joke they’ve ever heard, & they’re more inclined to share that, than the details of the weird carving they saw on a standing stone on the moors.
High levels of success with an NPC might not necessarily get the Hero exactly what they expect. It is up to the GM to decide how far along a winding path the Hero is led by the adventure, & what kind of mix of challenges would best suit a Player.

CHARACTERS FOUND AT A longhouse  

Leaders  
If the longhouse is an active place, then there is almost certainly one or more leaders present. This may be a king or queen, a prince or princess, or an entire royal family. In some cases, the true leader may be gone or lost & then a steward, retainer or trusted councilor might stand in for the leader.
By tradition, male leaders are expected to be more focused on warfare & exploration, while women are peace weavers & skillful deal-makers. However, both stories & histories are full of examples of folk who defied their common roles & provided exceptional leadership. Feel free to mix things up & have a young princess lead her folk to war or an aged king who only wants peace with his neighbors through diplomacy.
The Hero will want to present themselves to the leader as soon as practical, & it is also the leader’s responsibility to greet the Hero & put either restrictions or responsibilities (or both) on the Hero as the leader feels appropriate. As a guest in a foreign court, the Hero should respect the leader’s authority & try to work within the bounds they are given.
Usually, the leader will explain or recap the threat posed by the Monster & its recent activities. This should be used to set expectations & a timetable. A Monster that only hunts by the light of the full moon is less active than 1 who comes every night without fail. Thus the 1st Monster might have complex requirements to learn how to defeat it, whilst the 2nd is a more present threat & might need a simpler solution.
It is possible that the leader has been corrupted by the Monster, a changeling has taken their place, or that simple fear holds them in check. If this is the case, then you should provide the Hero with chances to discover this, either by speaking to others or by the leader struggling to resist the control, or inconsistencies in the narrative (be careful with this last one, we’re all human & make mistakes, so the Player might forgive you ‘mis-speaking’ without ever becoming suspicious).

Warriors  
Warriors around the Whale Road can be categorized into several types. Firstly, “the good”, who follow social expectations to the letter. They are loyal to their leader, & serve the longhouse by protecting its folk & keeping its laws. There are also more mundane types, who while not being exemplars of their class, are decent enough people. They might not be as brave as the best, most loyal hearth guards, nor be as willing to do their duty unto death. But they’re there to defend the hall when called upon.
Wandering warriors are largely held in great suspicion. The difference between a leaderless, oath-less warrior & a bandit is next to nothing. Where oaths & pledges of allegiance form the better part of the law, armed men & women who have no allegiance are literally “outlaws”. Whether the perception of such hearth-less wanderers is accurate is entirely up to the scenario.
Warriors may be sent as messengers from another longhouse, & they may have a demeanor which reflects their leader, or the nature of business between halls.
Warriors are frequently competitive, keen to prove their skills, loyalty & deeds in battles of words around the hearth. The Hero might encounter failed heroes who have tried to face down the Monster & might have valuable information for the Player or be simply passing through on a quest of their own.

Craftspeople  
Every settlement will have a number of craftspeople who serve the material needs of the community. The larger the settlement, & the richer its hall, the more specialized craftspeople might be found. Generally speaking, the more specialized & useful the craft, the higher the esteem assigned to the crafter.
- Weaver, leatherworker, garment-maker, embroiderer  
- tanner, jeweler  
- Antler or bone worker  
- Carpenter, builder, woodcarver, wood turner, wheelwright,  
shipwright, musical instrument maker  
- Potter, glass-maker  
- vellum maker  
- Charcoal burner  
- herbalist

There are a wide variety of craftspeople who are itinerant skilled workers travelling to where they are needed, alongside those who abide in a single hall, with the leader as their patron. It is not impossible for an entire settlement to be based around a single craft -- a renowned weapon smith might have their own hall. & while not as grand nor as martial as that of a king, it might still be a significant settlement in need of a Hero’s help.
Where craftspeople acquire their raw materials & tools is of great importance to both the settlements they serve & to them personally -- & thus to adventures.
How long crafts take to complete can have a big impact on a community & the craftspeople -- it can take months to tan hides, or season timber -- & requires craftspeople remain in place, preserving the community’s long term investment. This too can play a role in an adventure.

Clergy  
Devotees of the Church, the Followers of the Book can be found all around the Whale Road. Some rulers & kingdoms regard the Church as bringing many benefits, foremost amongst them being reading, writing & literature. Written law is in some places seen as the province of the more successful & beneficent ruler.
A member of the clergy of the Church might be a permanent advisor to the local ruler, or they might be present as part of a mission to bring knowledge of their faith to those who still worship the Old Gods.
Priests of the Church are generally considered separate to common society, & as favored guests of the local leader willing to reap the benefits of literacy & the promises of eternal life after death, may enjoy special privileges.
Some priests are well-read, wise, & benevolent, while others misuse their power & privilege for personal gain or control of a community. The variety of humanity & its relationship to power is not so different in the Age of Heroes.
The ways of the Old Gods generally place less emphasis on a class of clergy, & it is most common for rulers to lead observance of the Old Ways, any individual kingdom might have representatives of the Old Gods who oversee rituals & the local shrines. Being closer to the Old Gods may mean these individuals are in some way marked out as special or “god-touched”. They may speak in strange voices, or enact mysterious behavior. They may have a tyrannical influence over the community, wielding fear with the threat of a direct line to the supernatural, or they may simply be a wise elder of the community who marks the passing of the seasons & preserves the stories & traditions of their people.
A longhouse might be home to both representatives of the Church & the Old Ways, who may be locked in debate, may vie for attention & patronage, or live in a delicate balance under a leader who wants to hedge their bets, or who is yet to make a decision on what they believe.

Servants  
A number of those present in any longhouse will be there as servants, keeping house for their lord, bearing cups to guests, preparing food, maintaining the linen cupboard & so on. Servants do not share the privileges of warriors or noble folk, nor even craftspeople. But they have access to many more people & places within a settlement.
Whether a servant is proud of their community & hall, & works for its betterment, or harbors secret resentments & old grudges is the stuff of great stories. A wise Hero will be aware that servants go everywhere & see everything. Whether they are prepared to share anything they’ve seen is another matter.

Common Folk  
Most folk living around the Whale-Road are not specialized in a single craft or calling. They are subsistence farmers, living in family groups & performing a wide range of tasks to survive. Animal, land & woodland husbandry is complex & skilled work. The common folk tend to have many skills which they can perform to a competent level -- maintaining their own homes, enclosures, animals & modest crops. Some common folk subsist on hunting or simple tasks like wood-gathering, rather than having land to work. Common-folk may actually live in the longhouse, or have travelled here to socialize, to pay what they owe to their leader, or to request their help.

FOLLOWERS & ASSISTANTS  
A longhouse is very likely to include Followers in waiting, whether they are Simple Warriors, or more experienced Potential Followers, who could serve as trainers or advisors to the Hero. You may choose to have number of recruitable Followers prepared with a Follower Card, whether they’re likely to be used or not.
The attendees & associated hangers-on at the longhouse can be helpful Assistants. 1 or more of the workers might dream of a life on the open ocean & want to leave the hall. Others might be able to heal the Hero or provide advice during the course of the adventure. A hearth-guard or hunter might be sent with the Hero to guide them.
Such available Assistants should be listed out & a Follower card prepared for them. Even if your intention is that the Assistants remain at home after the adventure having a completed card speeds up gameplay.

INTERESTING FOLK  
Some of those present at a longhouse might not like the Hero or have an objection to them based on alignment or homeland. Others will be more welcoming. You can use these disputes & differences in attitude to highlight the Hero’s place in the world or to build eventual rapport between former enemies. Unferth challenges Beowulf ’s bragging rights but when the hero proves himself, he also recognizes Beowulf ’s greater strength & gifts him his sword. That journey between developing characters is an important one.

OTHER MEETING LOCATIONS  
The longhouse at the top of the hill does need to be the only place to visit in order to make introductions, though it almost always is the most appropriate place to start. In the absence of a longhouse a large farmhouse might provide a similar function. A famed smithy may provide the center of a settlement. A people driven out of their hall, & forced to live in the nearby ruins can provide the same kind of opportunity for a social encounter & investigation. The Hero might be invited into a private home or military encampment.
The rules of hospitality are the same for the lowest hovel as the richest longhouse; the host will provide food, drink & the safety of the house & the guest will do whatever they can to honor their host. Within a warriors battle camp, there is a great difference between known allies & suspicious strangers, & each will be treated accordingly.
More mythical places can also serve as meeting locations. The witch’s hut in the Forest is a common location, but so is a simple clearing, especially if you are fated to meet a Noble Animal. Sometimes the most meagre hut holds someone bound by prophecy to help the Hero in their quest.
The central location of the longhouse is a notional one, & it can take any number of forms. It doesn’t even need to have a gathering of people -- part of the challenge the adventure poses is travelling between far flung individuals, undergoing checks to locate the next one, & glean a little more information about the Monster. Once you understand the heart of this 2nd act is an idea, you can fly with it.

Meeting Noble Animals  
Most animals will seem out of place at many kinds of longhouse. If it is your destiny to meet a noble animal, it will most likely be in the wild somewhere (see the next section, opposite). Noble animals normally appear as exceptional individuals of their kind: larger than average, with an intelligence in their eyes that transcends normal beastly cunning.
Most noble animals are found in the wild, in places suitable for their kind. However, it may be possible that such a beast is waiting in town for the Hero, if they know that a Hero is coming. Most Heroes can identify noble animals on sight, unless the animal chooses to repress its own nature, perhaps as part of a test for a Hero.
Some noble animals might be able to fly, as adjudicated by the GM -- no noble animal is big enough to carry anyone or anything other than a small package or note.
A noble animal that is recruitable as an Assistant or Follower should have a Follower card. See page 85 for information about burdens & gifts for noble animals.

Background Texture  
In any meeting location of size, there might be a number of people who are there as observers, the household, hearth-guards & other folk who are not decision-makers & whose importance to the story being told is minimal. However, Players being Players, they still might be the subject of the Hero’s interest.
Feel free to have minimal details sketched up on these individuals. In fact, if you have a ready answer to a random individual’s name, occupation & purpose, many Players will assume that they must be important, since you knew such things without hesitation. There are a series of tables in the appendix of this book to help you create background NPCs.
Of course, a fun thing to do in roleplaying games is make the Player’s wildest theories turn out to be true, so if they spend an hour sharply interviewing a servant who has no planned knowledge or influence on the story, then it is within your purview to give her another character’s knowledge & make her important to the story.
Eventually, the investigation part of this 2nd longhouse act will either be complete, be interrupted, or will come to a premature end as the Monster makes its presence felt. Frequently this will result in the Hero travelling outside of the bounds of the hall, & into the wilds beyond.

EXPLORATION
The Hero will explore all kinds of environments in their search for the Monster. Some of these are natural -- wind-swept cliffs, caves hollowed out by slamming ocean waves or the slower drip, drip, drip of flowing freshwater, dangerous heights & deep forests, mud & muck, & sometimes, just sometimes, green grass & clear skies. Others are man-made, either by recent inhabitants or those of ancient days. & some, worst of all, were made by Monsters & there they still may dwell.
The encounters & challenges of the longhouse are very likely to see the Hero sent off to explore the surrounding area. & eventually it is very likely that the Monster will need to be hunted to its lair.

NATURAL FEATURES  
These cover non-constructed landscape features, though it can sometimes be hard to tell. Some have mistaken ancient burial mounds for natural hillocks & some caves were made by Dweorhas (dwarfs) or Ylfes (elves) for their own purposes. The natural aspects of the land are most often background details & the clues to the adventure are in how the people, or the Monster, have changed the landscape to suit their needs.

Caves  
Most caves that a Hero will encounter are either of the sea cave or karst varieties, although there are other, more scarce, options as well.
A sea cave is found at sea level, & made by the repeated waves on an area of the shore that has a weak spot. The water carries away some of the stone each time, creating a cave. It may be more easily accessible at low tide, or geological action may have caused part of the cave to rise above the water level, allowing some chambers to stay dry all the time. Sea caves make excellent lairs for Monsters that have some love of the sea & are also ideal for Heroes with smaller craft that might sail into the darkness in hunt of a monster. In the extreme areas of the north, the cave might be carved into the side of a glacier instead of stone.
A karst cave is formed by the slow action of water gaining natural acidity & then dissolving limestone as it percolates through the rock. As the water opens up new spaces, its accretion process creates artefacts such as flowstones, stalactites, stalagmites, helictites & columns of stone. These are the most common form of cave & most in-land caves will be of this type. They can be fairly simple (one or 2 large chambers, easily reached) or deadly complex (many such caves have small openings & long winding passages that can be very tight). The Monster might know their way in the darkness & trick a Hero into pursuing them into a dangerous area that has a sudden fall or precarious formations. Most of these caves will have submerged areas if the cave is deep enough to reach the local water table.
A primary cave is formed at the same time as the stone around it, usually by a lava tube -- the lava exposed to the air begins to cool while under the surface it continues to be liquid & flow downhill. If enough of it reaches the lower areas, then the upper areas of the flow will have tunnels beneath the surface. A Monster might make their lair in such a tunnel, especially if they’re fond of the earth or heat. Most such creations in the lands of our stories are truly ancient & are in no danger of becoming active again.
Rivers & winds can carve cave-like channels through stone, & if either can reach into a karst cave they can cause it to expand. Fracture & talus caves are formed by the collapse of rock & boulders & are temporary, not to mention extraordinarily unstable & dangerous.
For most of a Hero’s career, a complex cave system is as close as they may get to a ‘traditional’ dungeon. & they can be exciting in measure, providing new dangers (or at least the threat of a danger) around every corner & intelligent Monsters may use the many passages to out-maneuver the party & surprise them in the worst way. & certain cave features can be dangerous in themselves -- darkness, brittle nearly-eaten-away stone, deep cold water, sudden flooding or the appearance of predators or vermin as a distraction. If your Player enjoys the process of exploring a cave then they can feature more prominently, but for many Players they should be reserved for an ‘extra-special’ session featuring a Monster or other threat of significant challenge.

The Forest  
During the Age of Heroes, much of Northern Europe is covered with primordial forests. Eventually a time will come when these forests will be cleared, to build ships, homes, mills, & workshops & to provide fuel for a growing population. But for now, only a few live at the edges of the woods, & there are dark rumors about what lays within its depths. The hearts of forests are strange places, full of mysteries & said to be home to Ylfes & other Monsters. Folk might disappear into a forest & wander lost forever, or find themselves emerging from the woods far from home. Others say that they have accidentally gone to sleep in a glade only to find that years have passed once they return home, or that they have lost all memory of their former lives. Few folk go willingly into the deep wood.
For most adventures, the voyage signals the transition from the normal world to the dangerous world of Monsters. If you’re going to set an adventure in the Forest however, you might want to skip the voyage, or minimize it. Instead the hike to reach the heart of the forest becomes the voyage. You still generate the Portent as normal, but you’ll either want to adapt the challenges or make a suitable number of custom ones for the adventure.
Within the forest, meetings are less likely, at least with other humans. Noble Animals might be found more often, or perhaps a strange hermit that seems to live alone. The Hero might encounter a trio of strangers to deal with. In the old tales, these are most often treacherous witches or other dangerous folk, but perhaps they are just a small but normal family, or an unusual bonding that desires freedom from the scrutiny of life beyond the forest.
Elves live in the Dark Forest, in faerie mounds with secret or magical entrances or among the tops of trees. Few mortals see them (unless they wish to be seen) but their presence can be known by an eerie feeling of being watched as you explore the woods. Elves rarely serve as the Monster in a BEOWULF tale but they have no love for humans & might torment a Hero for their own amusement.
A Monster might lair up in a tree, or inside the hollow base of one, or in a clearing or small cave or thicket. Other dangers roam the Dark Forest as well, most notably hungry wolves but occasionally the forest might have reclaimed land once cleared & what looks like a hill with trees growing out of its top is actually an ancient barrow. Its occupants might be bothered by the roots tickling their dead feet & blame the Hero, unfortunately enough.

Farmland & Pastures  
These lands are not precisely ‘natural’ but many have been used for time out of mind. They are often on the edge of villages & towns, though a brave or desperate farmer might try plots further afield. Most fields near settlements belong to a certain family by ancient tradition & rows of stones divide the land. With more & more people settling down these plots are often subdivided -- some day they may get so small that a farmer cannot live off their own land, but for now there is enough for most families to be generous.
The most common crops are wheat, barley, & oats with legumes (beans & peas) as a common alternative crop. Farmhouses have crofts next to them where the farmer grows cabbages, onions, beans & peas, & often has an apple, cherry or pear tree.
Pastures are usually a little further away from population centers & require less maintenance. Folk keep cattle & oxen, hogs, sheep & sometimes horses. Younger members of the family are often assigned to keep watch as shepherds, often assisted by well-trained dogs.
Players will often think of farmland as part of the ‘safe’ area, along with villages & towns. A Monster attacking a farm or pasture is almost as transgressive as attacking the center of town. You can emphasize these contrasts by setting scenes in rapid succession: a hearty meal at the family’s table, followed by trudging out into the pasture to keep watch during the long hours of the night. As the Hero listens to the sounds of the darkness so close to the domestic tranquility of the farmhouse they might realize that this is another sort of boundary between civilization & wilderness.

Heathland & Moorland  
Heaths are stretches of open land where nothing taller than heather & wiry grasses grow. Moors are much the same, though the ground may be wetter & there might be a great accumulation of peat underneath the ground-cover, which can be dangerous for unwary travelers. Moorland can also mean a series of low hills, but 1 thing is certain -- there are no trees & little places to hide.
This desolation can bring a strong flavor to the adventure. In these lands, the Monster must have some special secret -- a hidden cave or hiding spot, or an ability to become invisible or disperse itself among the flat landscape. Perhaps there are 1 or more tors, chunks of stone revealed by the constant erosion that form strange shaped peaks at the tops of the hills where the Monster hides.

Island Aspects  
The seas of the Whale Road are dotted with countless islands, ranging hugely in size. During this time, as ships continue to explore the oceans, many islands are occupied. The isolation of an island, where no 1 can arrive or leave without others knowing of it can provide the perfect setting for a BEOWULF adventure.
Every island has some sort of border into the sea. Some islands have gently sloping beaches, others are at steeper angles with darker & sharper stones instead of soft sand. Still others have little other than stark cliffs that the waves pound against. Hopefully the Hero might find a sea cave with a well-worn passage all the way to the top of the island in such a case. Most inhabited islands are going to have some way of receiving visitors & shipments.
The island itself might have 1 or more different types of geography on it, depending on size. Many islands will have nothing other than heathland, others might have small (or big) stands of forests. Some might be more water than land & qualify as a brackish sort of swampland. Others might be the very tip of an underwater mountain emerging from the sea & resemble a mountain peak in shape but not height.

Lakes, Ponds, Rivers, Brooks, & Streams  
There is no precise difference between lakes & ponds, they are both stationary bodies of freshwater, though (on average) something called a lake will be bigger and/or deeper than a body of water called a pond.
The same is true with rivers, brooks, & streams -- a brook is likely smaller than a river, though both could be called a stream. All of them refer to moving freshwater, most often from a higher elevation where snowmelt or an underground spring provides a source to a lower drainage point, which could be a lake, a pond, some sort of wetland (see below) or the ocean itself. Some are seasonal, some are year-long but wax & wane with the weather & climate.
Sources of freshwater are important not only for daily life but also for agriculture & many valuable trades. Flowing water also can provide access to resources otherwise inaccessible, for example panning for gold or silver, collecting smooth river rocks or digging for clay on a river’s banks. Most settlements are near a water source, & a Hero who finds a river or lake on their travels might readily guess that they are close to civilization.

Marshes, Swamps, Fens, & Bogs  
All of these terms refer to wetlands & the primary differences are in the amount of water present & the types of plants. Marshes have standing or slow-moving freshwater, or a mix of fresh & saltwater in salt marshes, found near coasts. Marshes have smaller plants & bushes, adapted for the water conditions.
Swamps are similar but usually have more exposed land & always have trees. Fens are areas where soil saturated with water has been trapped by a layer of peat & moss, & are usually covered by grasses, sedges, rushes & wildflowers. Bogs are similar but rely more on rainfall or other external water sources.
All of these wetlands are known for their great variety of life -- many different types of birds roost or hunt in the area, there are amphibians, eels & other fish in the water, reptiles hiding in the grass & even bigger creatures that hunt lesser ones as well. A wide variety of plants call the wetlands home & in some unusual conditions, even ‘hunt’ for their meals instead of taking it from the soil, sunshine & air. Especially at night, these lands sing with life & a Hero might feel out of place amid the reeds & water.
If a Monster lives here, it might be semi-aquatic, hiding from the sun or hunters during the day by digging into mud & muck, & then emerging to hunt at night. Others might just make use of the intimidating terrain & live at the center of a swamp or fen. There will be people here as well, hunters & trappers who rely on the wetlands for food, or those that gather & dry peat as a fuel or fertilizer.
It is of note that the people who became known as the Anglo-Saxons left mainland Europe in part due to rising sea levels turning their homeland to marsh & swamp. & so swamp, whether primordial or spreading fenlands, may well be remembered as a place of some horror.
Heroes should feel off-balance in wetlands, forced to either stand in the muck & deal with difficult terrain or guide a small boat or raft amid the pools of water, hunting for something that can surely see them, but is hidden from the Hero’s sight.

Mountain-Lands  
Just like the Dark Forest provides a different sense of adventure rather than a more usual trip to an island or seashore location, so does the challenge of reaching a mountainous location. You can use the Portent system as normal, but you will likely want to present challenges unique to the environment & especially the changing climate of mountains -- the higher the Hero must climb, the more dangerous environments they will face (see Great Heights, below).
The lowest part of the mountains tend to be surrounded by smaller hills & clad in trees. Many mountains provide the source for streams & rivers, & their sources can often be found here -- springs emerging from the rock, or snowmelt slowly gathering & then spilling down into the lowlands. As you head up the mountain, the trees become more sparse & hardy. There may be meadows of grass & wildflowers with no trees at all. Sometimes you might find a flat shelf of ground formed by the mountain’s movement. Such places might have ponds or lakes, surrounded by plants. The ground is soft here, full of peat. Higher up, there are almost no plants at all, just bare stone & snow. At these heights, it remains cold enough that the snow remains all year long.
Mountains may make you think of spectacular views & thoughtful isolation, but there may be some inhabitants, shepherds at the lower heights moving their herds up the side of the mountain as the seasons change (and then back down to the lowlands), hermits who wish to be left alone (perhaps with dark secrets), miners seeking rich veins underneath the mountain. Mountains are also the traditional home of Dweorhas (dwarfs), along with some Eotenas (trolls & ogres) & Gīgantas (giants).
Mountains provide a series of dangers to the Hero, several of which must be personally overcome.They are high places & may have religious associations, even if not they almost demand a sort of secular reverence, because of the effort required to reach their heights. Monsters here might reflect these sentiments, causing the Hero introspection & new points of view, or they might represent the raw power of nature & its many dangers.

Great Heights  
None of the mountains around the Whale Road are so high as to worry about the lack of air at their heights. But the peaks will be considerably colder than the feet of the mountains, & there can be other dangers, such as avalanches, crevasses that are hidden by accumulated snow, areas that can only be reached by vertical climbing, falling rocks, weathered formations that break as soon as weight is applied & others. You can use these sorts of dangers as challenges -- in this way, the ascent of the mountain becomes a background element (much like the Voyage) told in a montage of challenges & then the true adventure begins at the top of the mountain.

The Sea  
The ocean is an element in almost all BEOWULF stories, it is the Whale Road, the means by which the Hero reaches their new adventure. The sea also provides isolation, especially around islands, so that a Monster can threaten a place or people & they have little recourse other than to endure it.
You can use the ocean to represent the mood of the adventure. If you want the Hero to feel trapped then the wind blows, raising great waves that slam onto the shore & causing driving rains that demand everyone stay inside while the Monster hunts in the storm. If you want a more introspective air, then the wind is nonexistent & the ocean is flat, reflecting only the clouds & birds flying overhead. When the Hero vanquishes the Monster, the clouds part, the sun is warm & a gentle breeze blows towards the Hero’s home (or next destination).
The ocean is also deadly, especially in Northern Europe, though it is dangerous everywhere in the world. But, especially during the cold months, the North Sea & the Baltic Sea can be dangerous for a sailor who goes overboard or a ship that capsizes, as the low water temperature means that a victim might have only minutes before hypothermia sets in. Sharks & sea-monsters also swim these seas & blood in the water will draw them to the attack.

ANCIENTS & GIANTS  
In the stories of the Migration Era, there are 2 groups of people who stand out as needing special attention. The 1st of these, which story tellers call ‘the ancients’ represent the forebears & assorted relations of the folks who are telling the stories. They represent a time even before the age of Beowulf, recalling ancient Byrthonic tribes, the Celts, the nameless forebears of the Picts, the Sami & others. Some of these people are still separate groups, having been changed by contact with others, & some are trying to keep their own cultural identities. Our stories are largely seen through the eyes of Anglo-Saxon storytellers, telling heroic stories, & thus ancient or distant peoples may appear in a story as strange & mysterious; whereas in their own tales, the Anglo-Saxons are the strange foreigners with barbaric customs.
The 2nd group are held to be among the giants: builders of the great ruined cities, pavers of long & steady roads, makers of walls that span an entire land, & other such impossibilities. The organization & resources needed to operate on the scale of an ancient empire is simply impossible to imagine for the folk of The Whale Road, & so their remains are wholly mysterious & unknowable.
In the game, both of these folk provide handy providers of ancient ruins, weird inscriptions, half-remembered legends & such.
Many fantasy settings touch on the idea that once, long ago, there were great people who knew more than present day folk knew & were capable of miracles. This is the source of that inspiration. That the world was once greater than the present folk have known was a key part of medieval philosophy & that provides an excellent excuse for adventures.

Barrows  
Since the days of the earliest ancients, people have built barrows in a variety of shapes & for different purposes. Some are round, some are more rectangular; some are aligned to important natural features such as the winter solstice, others seem to disregard such things; some hold many bodies, some have none. They are built with local materials: wood, stone or clay. There are also dolmen, tombs made out of menhir (very large stones). No 1 knows why the ancients built these, & there are likely to be dangerous secrets to do with their construction or whomever lies buried within.
In some areas the people still make use of the barrows for burials. This may be part of an unbroken tradition that stretches back to the dawn of memory, or it may just be that they are taking advantage of an existing structure. Of course, there’s a danger that the dead may not remain in peaceful rest if they are disturbed.
You can use barrows in many ways. Foremost they provide the threat of the undead, as many tales are known of the Dréag -- the again-walkers who do not stay in their graves -- & the Héag -- the mound-dwellers that protect their fellow dead against who would rob the tombs. But they also might house the Monster, especially an impossibly old dolmen built by the ancients & recently rediscovered. Or the barrow or dolmen might attract the Monster, providing some clue as to its goals & desires.

Ruins  
Both the ancients & the giants produced ruins, though the works of the giants are much more extensive than those of the ancients. In some places they built entire cities, only to abandon them as their time waned. The people of the Whale Road have no use for these cities & steer clear of them - they are full of ghosts & old curses, & are not a healthy nor wise place to linger.
Current-day rulers often do not have the skills or labor required to maintain the forts as the giants did, so when an old building fails it is often replaced by 1 built in the current style. Thus, a well-maintained fortress might contain a mix of roundhouses, longhouses & giant-built structures.
Ruins can be a source of Monsters, if some ancient defensive magic is destroyed by careless looting or new construction. Or a Monster from the old days might return to the ruins because it has memories of what once flourished there. Having a battle with the Monster set in ruins can offer some spectacular scenes with lots of changing terrain as walls or columns come tumbling down, or a floor gives way, collapsing both Monster & Hero into darkness.

Standing Stones  
Both the ancients & the giants raised up stones, though often for different reasons.
The stones made by the ancients are rougher in nature but often possess supernatural power. Solitary stones are called menhir & are sometimes arranged into complex structures (the most famous of which is Stonehenge). Standing stones are often labelled, the three most likely systems are ogham (the writing used by the ancients), picture-stones (illustrations that impart information without any specific language being used) & runes (used by the Anglo-Saxons & their neighbors to the east). Any of these could be used for ordinary, everyday information or for magic spells & protective charms. An investigative Hero will want to pay careful attention to the standing stones.
Standing stones, especially with writing, are a great way to convey information to the Hero. Even just their presence can be valuable information -- in an area that has little worked stone, the fact that a menhir has been left alone by later folks indicates that they believe it to be special or powerful. Or if such a stone has been recently disturbed & only then did the Monster begin to trouble the people, it is likely that they are related. And, of course, stones with writing on them might provide riddles or clues to the Hero or, if necessary, explain to them what is going on in plain terms.

BUILT STRUCTURES  
These are homes, defensive structures, work-centers & other buildings made by the present-day inhabitants, their direct ancestors or another people known to those folk who occupy the land now. The Monster might attack such buildings directly or as part of an effort to reach the common folk cowering within.
Structures can be built out of wattle & daub (woven sticks & mud), thatch (gathered grasses), sod, wood, stone, or a combination of materials. Seasonal or temporary structures are often made out of easier to work materials, with permanent structures having more effort invested in them. However, a temporary structure might acquire a sort of permanency over time, as regular visitors continue to repair, refine & expand the building to suit their needs.

Dwellings  
Depending on the age & who lives in them, this could be older style roundhouses, usually made out of wattle & daub with thatched roofs, similar roundhouses with a stone wall & a sod roof, wooden longhouses with thatched roofs, or sometimes a triangular hut again with a thatched roof.
Many longhouses have sunken floors, giving more space inside & helping with temperature regulation. The most elaborate can have ‘cellars’ of 9ft deep, meaning that there is a suspended floor with foodstuffs & other supplies stored below the central hall.
Families live together with little expectation of privacy. In bad weather, the family’s animals join them in the shelter, providing even less available space. If a person invites someone into their house, they become responsible for keeping that person safe & that person becomes (temporarily) part of the family & is expected to behave as such. Defying the expectations of hospitality can create a blood-feud, providing a strong incentive to honor the traditions. Guests should be quick to announce their loyalties & attachments, a Hero who answers to a king is more trustworthy, because they have more to lose by betraying an oath.

Outbuildings  
Workshops & storage areas often follow the same sort of architecture as the dwellings of the area, but are smaller (or larger) depending on the needs of the building’s purpose. Additionally, the chosen profession may influence the structure of the building. A people that prefer to work with wood & straw might still build a smithy out of loose-fitted stone to reduce the danger of fire. The amount & kind of outbuildings can speak to the wealth (or poverty) of a village or town.

Defensive Structures  
In history, walls & ditches were surprisingly uncommon around Anglo-Saxon settlements, & they seemed to have relied on the security of the Hall, & its door as their primary defensive structure.
The Whale Road in the Age of Heroes is long & broad, & in the interests of variety & adventure, a Hero may also encounter other kinds of defenses. Beyond a strong hall, the most common defensive structure is a palisade made of sharpened logs, situated upon a dyke before a ditch. Sometimes additional fence stakes might be leaned forward, such that they helped brace the fence but also exposed their points to any attackers. A thick hedge of thorns may be cultivated atop a dyke, or an especially strong animal fence might be deployed to defend a settlement. More ancient defenses might see reuse - tumble-down stone defenses built centuries before by the giants or the ancients, or mysterious, ruined double-skinned towers, or odd rectangular enclosures might be re-inhabited in times of need.
The state of defensive structures is an important clue to the situation at hand for a Hero. If the location has strong & well-maintained defenses then they are martially-focused & ready to face enemies. If those defenses are recently destroyed that is a sign of tremendous force & dedication by a Monster or enemy. If the defenses are untended & left in a state of disrepair, the place might not face threats often or the leaders of the land are inattentive or unwise.

Temporary Places  
Hunters & travelers might construct makeshift shelters as they travel. Some of these might become semi-permanent as the same location is used over & over again throughout the years or if several different people make use of the site. The simplest sorts of construction is often with unfinished wood or simple earthworks -- a lean-to or windbreak. These can be expanded into a full hut or actual house with additional work.
Visitors to these areas can quickly determine the status of the structure. If it is in good shape, any damaged areas patched, & especially if it is stocked with supplies then the Hero can determine that it is in regular use & might even expect to see others soon, depending on the time of year. However, if it is weathered & broken down then it may have been some time since anyone used it. This could be part of the story, if a Monster chased away or consumed all the game or slew all of the hunters.

Abandoned Buildings  
Unlike temporary locations, these structures were built to house people all the time but are now no longer in use. They will be similar to the Dwellings & Outbuildings referenced above but may have extensive damage. Timber is so easily come by in this age that many settlements built by the Anglo-Saxons drift across the landscape year by year. It is easier to build a new timber house than to repair an old one. The Hero will likely want to determine who used to occupy the buildings & what became of them.

Ships, Boats & Wrecks  
Many locations that the Hero visits will be near the ocean as the Whale Road is the most prominent way that people will reach the land. On suitable beaches, you might see a motley collection of boats & ships, both of local & foreign make. Very few vessels are designed to stay in the water all of the time, most are supposed to spend at least part of their lives on a sandy beach.
Boats are smaller craft, designed for fishing or transporting supplies or people between larger vessels. While they almost certainly have an owner, they often don’t have a designated or permanent crew (except for family-owned fishing vessels). Ships are bigger, designed for deep water operation & can support their crew without regular landings. That said, most sailors of this age prefer to hug the coastline, landing the ship each night & sleeping on solid ground.
Building a ship or boat is 1 of the most complex construction projects undertaken by most societies & can take months or years. Due to the importance of the Whale Road, shipbuilders are important craftspeople in every society & 1 way to measure the wealth or success of a kingdom is by how many ships it can send forth (along with the number of warriors). For more information on using ships, see page 7.
Sailing does not always go smoothly & the Hero is likely to encounter ruined ships on occasion. There are 2 primary types of wreck: underwater & on land. Of course, some wrecks might be only partially submerged.
To explore an underwater wreck, the Hero & any accompanying Followers will have to hold their breath & swim to the ship. If the ship has been underwater for any length of time, finding bodies is unlikely -- the local sea life will have already consumed their flesh & scattered the bones. Still, other valuable things may remain, & if the Monster is the 1 responsible for sinking the ship then the Hero might learn valuable clues from inspecting the ship.

Holding Your Breath  
A creature can hold its breath for 1+CON minutes (min 30sec). When a creature runs out of breath or is choking, it can survive for a number of rounds equal to its CON (minimum of 1 round). At the start of its next turn, it drops to 0 HP & is dying, & it can’t regain HP or be stabilized until it can breathe again.

MONSTER LAIRS  
A Monster can lair in any environment -- many will find a suitable cave, forest thicket or ruin & be well satisfied. Other monsters might be more subtle & have powers that allow them to live in disguise among the people. Others might be more incorporeal & fade into their surroundings, often haunting a location of great significance to themselves. Some live next to or in the water & might only come onshore to hunt or might never leave the water.
A Monster that is representative of a natural force (even 1 being corrupted or disturbed by human activity) is likely to have a lair in a natural object. Conversely, those Monsters who are descended from corrupt people or the cursed line of Cain are more likely to lair in some place that has some memory of the ancients, the giants or other people. This is not always true -- Grendel’s mother kept herself in a cave at the bottom of a deep lake despite her heritage & dragons often seek out man-made barrows for the treasure stored within.
It is not unknown for Monsters, which are themselves “of the impossible” to dwell in impossible spaces. Places that only appear under certain conditions, at certain times, when the right words are sung, or which seem to defy natural laws.

THE MONSTER
This chapter talks about the monsters of BEOWULF but does not have any stat blocks in it (those begin on page 185). Instead, this chapter concerns itself with what the Monster means within the story & how to deploy it (or them, since you will sometimes have more than 1 Monster).

USING THIS CHAPTER  
Monsters serve as the ultimate foe of the Hero. The battle against the Monster is most often the climax of a BEOWULF adventure. The destruction of the Monster solves the kingdom’s problem, allowing the leaders to celebrate & reward the Hero. In some adventures, things are not so simple -- perhaps the Monster must be driven away & cannot be slain or perhaps the leader or others must take action to set things right.
From the storyteller’s point of view, the Monster often represents something important about the world, something beyond the control of ordinary folk. Grendel might represent a force of nature, or the power of evil, slaying with strength that no normal person can withstand. His mother might represent the dangers of blood-feuds, as she takes revenge for her son but is also slain in her turn.
And the dragon? Perhaps it represents the greed of the wealthy & their apparent invulnerability to the masses. Or perhaps, in other tales, the dragon is a dragon, a beast of fire & power, to thrill the audience & do combat with our Hero.

THE ORIGINS OF THE MONSTER  
Every Monster has a source & determining this can help define the Monster & suggest its strengths & weaknesses. We’ve come up with the following general categories, though it’s possible that some Monsters don’t fit into any of these, or perhaps could belong to more than one.

Born of Evil  
Beowulf the poem traces some of Grendel & his mother’s lineage for us. The church-going scribes tell us that they are descended from Cain, who murdered his own brother. Thus some Monsters are inherently evil, a notion that we know does not apply to people in the real world, but is exceedingly helpful for a storyteller setting up a clear threat to a Hero.
Monsters that are born of evil are irredeemable within the sagas. They represent things that man cannot control & that only Heroes have a chance of defeating.

Transformed by Power  
These Monsters were made, not born. Perhaps a powerful sorcerer placed a curse on them, or they made such a terrible decision that 1 of the gods punished them directly, or another Monster caught them & made the person become a Monster themselves. These Monsters were not originally evil & thus there is some hope for them.
A Monster transformed by power might be able to be saved or restored by the actions of the Hero, especially if they learn the exact method used to transform them into evil. In the sagas, these stories of redemption still often end with the erstwhile monster dying anyway -- the person that became the Monster will likely bear guilt for everything they did as the Monster & even the most forgiving community would be hard-pressed to lay no blame at their feet.

Twisted by Nature  
In the far corners of the world & deep places of the sea there are terrible things waiting to be found. These Monsters are not inherently evil, nor were they made evil by another power. Instead they are part of nature & have natural reasons for their actions -- they attack & consume because they are hungry, they fight to protect their den or offspring, or wreak havoc to win a mate. Their instincts are not evil, but when they run counter to the needs of people they can still come into conflict.
It might be that a clever Hero can find a resolution for a natural Monster, though most cannot reason or clearly communicate with people. Otherwise, to slay this kind of Monster is a grim need. Like a wolf that hunts sheep, they must not be allowed to continue but neither does the wise person begrudge them for making the attempt.

The Unresting Dead  
In these dark & tumultuous times even the sleep of the dead is troubled. Some of the undead are of only minor concern -- the barrow-folk that guard their kin from grave robbers are of little concern except for those who steal from the dead. But the dead who wander away from their resting place, seeking revenge or other evil things, are Monsters that must be reckoned with. Similar spirits sometimes emerge from the sea, with accusing stares for the living that failed to rescue them.
Most undead Monsters can only be laid to rest by being bodily destroyed, releasing the spirit & depriving it of a vessel. However, some that have returned because of a driving need to complete a task might have their passage eased if the Hero is able to help the spirit instead of fighting it.

BUILDING THE MONSTER  
Most of the creatures in the Bestiary have the potential to be Monsters, but none of them are Monsters according to their base stat blocks. This is because in order to qualify as ‘capital-M’ Monster, it must have a driving force behind it, something that may make it undefeatable, at least until the Hero acquires the necessary knowledge or technique in order to slay it. This may be a magic of its own kind (and likely offset by some talisman of the ancients unless the monster has roamed freely forever), or part of its inheritance (creatures born of evil might quail in the face of sincere religious conviction), it might be a secret weakness (such as a vulnerability to a certain metal, or a missing scale on its armored body), or even time of day or location (such as an undead that possesses great power in its barrow but, if tricked into the bright sunlight is easily destroyed).
It is worthy of note that some adventures will reveal the backstory of a Monster as the riddle of how to defeat it is resolved. Other adventures will not concern themselves with this at all.

The Base Stat Block  
Each stat block in the Bestiary is not a Monster. Instead it is a base version of a creature that can serve as a common Foe, or if so desired, be upgraded into a Monster. To be a Monster, a creature needs the undefeatable special trait (see next page), & a means by which that special trait can be removed.
It serves most adventures to have some kind of story, however simple, attached to the Monster to make it a worthy foe for a Hero, & to make defeating it a satisfying challenge.
Transforming a creature into a Monster raises the creature’s challenge rating by 2 steps, e.g. from CR 2 to 4 or from 1/8 to 1/2. A Hero with a full complement of Followers is able to handle a Monster within a few challenge steps difference. For example, a Lv1 Hero will have a stiff challenge with a challenge 4 Monster whereas a challenge 1 Monster will be less of an overall threat.
It is entirely permissible & desirable to create your own unique Monsters from scratch, enabling them to be a true mystery & a never-before discovered challenge. You’ll find many new & unique Monsters in published adventures for BEOWULF: Age of Heroes.

The Monstrous Gift: Undefeatable  
The Undefeatable special trait is common to almost all Monsters, & it is what makes them appear impossible to slay. It prevents the Monster from taking significant damage until the Hero uncovers some salient collection of information, helpers, or items, that will allow them to achieve victory. In mechanical terms the Hero is most often attempting initially to remove the undefeatable trait.
**Undefeatable**: This creature is immune to the Defeated condition. When an undefeatable creature takes damage from any source it only takes 1 point of damage.

Strange Foes From Afar  
The bestiary included draws from the Beowulf poem & adjacent materials to build a selection of foes, including mortal adversaries, wild beasts & a variety of monstrous foes. But the Whale Road is long & there are many places between the 2 seas that are unexplored. If you want to feature a creature from a different source that’s no problem. You may want to help give it an appropriate moniker by using the table on page 125 listing categories & kennings (brief descriptive phrases).
When bringing a monster in to visit, also remember that very few Heroes have any proper magic about them. Use the Undefeatable gift to reflect supernatural resistances & immunities & raid our bestiary for other gifts or burdens that can represent a creature’s magical features or weaknesses.

MEETING THE MONSTER  
Grendel is not an unfamiliar foe for Hrothgar or his folk, they have seen the work of the Monster many times & many have tried & failed to stand against him. During the course of your adventure, the Monster can make themselves known in similar ways. These appearances can take several different forms, & as many writers of thrillers recommend, sometimes less is more -- a half-seen, half-guessed at Monster is more scary than something that is clearly seen, identified & catalogued.

Consequences  
The most mysterious way for a Monster to make their appearance is just by seeing the consequences of their actions -- broken doors, toppled piles of stone, blood stains, bits of discarded clothing, wargear or even body parts. If the creature can attack at will & remain unseen the entire time, what can the common folk do against it?
As the Hero 1st learns of the Monster, the tales of most folk should take this shape, allowing them to realize that there is an enemy present but each individual interview provides little definitive information.

Signs & Spoor  
If the Hero braves the haunts of the Monster then they might see signs or spoor of the Monster. These will be things like bent or broken branches, huge footprints, tufts of hair or skin left behind, perhaps even a discarded weapon or tool. Some Monsters may leave behind a strong odor that lasts for some time, which the Hero might be able to follow to a lair or favored hunting ground.

The Monster Attacks  
This is the most direct way for the Monster to make an appearance & perhaps the most dangerous. Players are Heroes after all, & Heroes don’t like to flee from Monsters. Fortunately, their Followers might help get them out of a dangerous situation if they have not yet discovered the Monster’s weakness.
Perhaps the best compromise here is for the Monster to attack another group & have the Hero arrive just in time to see the consequences of the attack & receive information from eyewitnesses without seeing the Monster themselves. The Monster may be working to its own agenda, & have no wish to stand & fight at this time. Be wary of pitting your Hero toe-to-toe with an unbeatable foe too soon. There is a careful balance in keeping the pressure on the Player, without really pushing them into an unwinnable fight.

LORE & MONSTERS  
Beowulf mostly gets lucky in defeating his monsters: he quickly judges that facing Grendel unarmed is the key to success, he finds the sword that slays Grendel’s mother within her own lair, & he has mixed luck with the dragon -- Naegling breaks upon the dragon’s skull, but Wiglaf ’s sword & Beowulf ’s dagger prove sufficient in the end. His plans, such as they are, are made quickly & in the heat of the moment, to surprise & delight the listener or reader.
In BEOWULF: Age of Heroes we have translated this into situations where the Hero can take a little more time & have a reasonable chance of discovering the Monster’s weakness, & can then take action to make that happen. Being lucky, & making spur of the moment choices is exciting in both stories & games but if everything comes down to blind chance then the Player will easily become frustrated. Many of the ancillary stories are about the cleverness of humans.

The Monster’s Secret  
If the Monster has some sort of secret weakness, it is likely that someone knows this secret, or at least once knew it. It may have become part of the local legend of the monster & the Hero has to sort the truth from various rumors & other legendary components. It may have been known to the ancients & recorded on a stone somewhere in Ogham. Or perhaps the secret was entrusted to a special group of people & they currently possess the secret. Or perhaps they no longer realize the significance of what they know & the Hero must convince them to investigate their own archives or reflect on the true meaning of an ancient riddle.
Those who know may need some show of good faith from the Hero, or require their help in order to share what they know.
If the Monster’s weakness is entirely unknown then it needs to fit into the logic of the story. In other words, there must be hints available as to its nature. For example a creature that is weak to iron might take great measures to prohibit people in the area from carrying such weapons. Discovering & understanding these hints form the adventure.
A Monster’s secret need not be complex, rather just hidden at first, waiting to be uncovered by the Hero to resolve the story. It may be made of parts, or simply require unusually brave deeds that those who are not Heroes are unable to perform. Most of all it needs to be satisfying, & while it has no need to be logical in a scientific sense, it should make some kind of poetic sense.

The Monster’s Lair  
Most monsters will have some kind of lair. The lair of the Monster may serve as a safe hiding place, or it might be that the Monster was once trapped there & now remembers nothing else. It may be that the Monster took it from people or other monsters & now considers it a place of power. It might be remote & inaccessible, such that the Monster feels safe there because no 1 else could possibly survive the trek. It might be underwater, so deep that the Hero would need to hold their breath for an impossibly long time in order to reach the lair. Discovering how to reach the home of the beast might well form part of an adventure’s challenge.

The Monster’s Goal  
Each Monster desires something -- for the more primitive kinds, these needs are simple: a steady supply of food, sufficient shelter, & peace from intrusive Heroes that would slay it. Others will be more complex -- they may be trying to achieve power or keep it, they might seek revenge, or to destroy their bindings, to punish those they feel have wronged them, or to trick mortals into doing evil acts. Knowing a Monster’s goal will help develop the plot of the adventure as it will inform you of what the Monster will want to do whenever it has a chance to act. “Why?” Is a very common question for a Hero to ask, & there should be an answer, even if it is never fully understood.

Defeating the Monster  
Generally speaking, for most BEOWULF adventures, the Hero will need to discover what the Monster is, where it is, how to make it vulnerable to some kind of attack, & then plan & execute that attack. But “attack” is a broad word to use here. Some kinds of monster may not need to be slain with swords & spears once they are made vulnerable to being defeated. They may gain the Defeated condition by losing a battle of wits. Or by removing the log bridge back into their cave, exposing them to the dawning sunlight. Or by being driven off with fire. Others will indeed need to be smote with blades once they become vulnerable to attack.
The Defeated condition provides ample inspiration for different ways a Monster might cease to be a threat to a local community. Once subject to the Defeated condition a creature may (1d8):  
1. have its fighting spirit broken & attempt to flee, never to be seen again
2. surrender to the creature who inflicted the Defeated condition
3. become doomed to die from wounds, slinking away never to be seen again
4. be in some way disarmed, or transformed
5. become vulnerable to suggestion or command by a Hero
6. be permanently pinned, imprisoned or immobilized
7. become harmless in some other way the GM invents to fit the circumstance

It is important to provide varied challenges, & to bear in mind the nature of your Player’s Hero. If they are playing a bookish, intelligent Hero, they may well prefer challenges that are more cerebral, requiring careful investigation & planning, rather than delivering 1d8 damage per round. A Bench Breaker might just want to lop off a Monster’s head. Be sure to allow for these outcomes when you design a monster & its accompanying challenges. Your Player will enjoy using their Hero’s special abilities to defeat a Monster. Of course, mixing it up once in a while can also be fun!

Other kinds of Monster  
While the vast majority of Monsters encountered around the Whale Road are at least something like giant beasts & trolls, literal monsters to be battled in hand-to-hand combat, occasionally a Hero might encounter a stranger kind of monster which doesn’t conform to the “gigantic creature” monster-type. Underneath a superficially different skin, there’s no reason why a more lateral kind of threat can’t be dealt with in a very similar way to a regular Monster. A cloud of poisonous fumes, an ancient cure or blight, or a school of skeletal seals might play the part of the Monster, & require a similar investigation & then planned confrontation. The final resolution may not be a battle using spears.

DEFEATING A MONSTER  
Once the Hero knows the Monster’s weakness & the Monster’s location, then they can prepare themselves for a final confrontation. This should rarely be the 1st time the Hero & the Monster have met, but it should be the 1st that the Hero knows how to defeat the Monster.
The location of this final conflict should be in a significant location: the Monster’s lair, the Mead-hall of the Ruler that hired the Hero or a place of significance in the Monster’s story -- for example, the site of a ghost’s now-lost family home or the place where the Monster was cursed or transformed into the terror that it is now. The Hero’s remaining Followers should be there as well, ready to take their final actions in support of the Hero.
The fate of the Monster should be clear. If the Monster does not die, it should be ‘fixed’ in time & space. For example it might be entombed in its own lair, never to re-emerge until the stars themselves change. Or if it flees, the scop should be clear to say that it never troubled those lands again. In every case, if the Hero succeeds then it should be a clear victory.

MORE THAN 1 MONSTER  
Sometimes the Monster may not be alone. You might decide to have a mated pair of Monsters appear, or have the Monsters share a family connection, like Grendel & his mother. They may even be Monsters of 2 different kinds who have agreed to work together -- an ogre & a sea brute that lay claim to anyone who approaches their small island, dividing the danger & the man-flesh between them. Monsters that are found as a pair should be weaker individually than singular monsters but also should be usually encountered together. Remember, of course, that a pair of Monsters has 2x as many turns as a singular Hero so multiple Monsters should probably have a challenge rating equal to or lesser than the Hero’s level. It is also possible that the Monsters may appear in sequence, like Grendel’s mother only showing up once her son was mortally wounded, or what is likely to occur in The 3 Ogre Brothers, since each brother tends to remain in their own domain. In this case, the Monsters can be of equal or escalating challenge to the Hero, since each will appear individually & the Hero will have a chance to recover after each meeting.

REST & REWARDS
Once the Hero has successfully defeated the Monster, the adventure is drawing to an end. But it is not quite over -- after the successful completion of a mission there is a time for celebration, reward & perhaps some subtle politics.
While the scops rarely concern themselves with what Heroes do when they are not adventuring, we do provide some structure to these times, in order to more readily set the stage for the next adventure.

USING THIS CHAPTER  
You can use this chapter as a guide to bringing a BEOWULF adventure to a satisfactory conclusion. A completed story should contain many, if not all, of the following components in order to meet the Player’s expectations.

RETURN TO THE longhouse  
Unless the Monster was defeated as it attacked the longhouse, the Hero will want to return to the leader of the community with evidence of the creature’s destruction or testimony of it fleeing the area. Sometimes such evidence may not exist -- Heroes are by necessity trustworthy people & so the leaders will naturally believe them when they report that the Monster was destroyed or exiled. Of course, a Hero that abuses this faith will become known as false & no longer trusted.
If you want to represent this mechanically, assign the Hero the false burden, allowing them to make it temporary after 1 adventure in which they tell no lies & then removing it after a 2nd sequential adventure with no falsehoods:
**False**: The Hero is known for untruths; they have -DisAdv on CHA checks that rely on honesty.

When the Hero returns to the longhouse they gain the benefit of a Long Rest. Afterwards, the Hero will be fêted by the leader & the community with both food & alcohol in abundance. They will be asked to relate the story of their experiences many times & their Followers will be encouraged to add their own observations & wry remarks. This helps solidify the experience & creates the tale that the scop has told of the Hero’s adventure.

Experience Points  
Some Gamemasters will want to eschew experience points (XP), using appropriate moments in the narrative to increase a Hero’s level instead. For those who do want to use XP, the following table gives awards for adventures such that a character will always experience 2 adventures at a given level -- the 1st to experience their new features & the 2nd to enjoy their mastery of those features.

| Current Lv | XP Award x100 |
| ---------- | ------------- |
| 1          | 2             |
| 2          | 4             |

| 19         | 300           |
| 20         | 400           |

If you choose to use the XP given above, here are some suggestions for how to break the total up into an XP award for the Monster, any generic enemies, rewards for meeting with NPCs & rewards for discovering information.
Most of these smaller rewards can be subdivided between multiple opportunities (e.g. if you have a budget of 600xp for meetings & 5 major NPCs then a success with each of them can be worth 125xp).
A challenge rating suggestion is given next to the XP components for appropriate entries.

Achievement Awards  
Some GMs will not be interested in breaking down XP awards into discrete amounts. If that’s you, you can think of each category (Monster, Enemies, Meetings, & Investigation) as an award category. You might even predetermine particular, adventure-specific Achievements in each category that the Hero might complete. When the Hero receives 6 or 7 awards over the course of a couple adventures then they’re ready for the next level. Some adventures might not feature a certain category, so you might sometimes have multiple Investigation awards or a high number of Meeting awards, for example.
Or, if you want to be even simpler, 2 completed adventures (or even 1 completed adventure for a faster pace) might be all the Hero needs to gain a new level. Conversely you can slow the pace down by requiring 3 or more complete adventures (or 9 awards if you use the above method).

Additional Achievement Awards  
Achievements don’t have to fall neatly into 1 of the 4 categories above. As long as the Hero achieves something noteworthy or makes significant forward progress you can reward them with an Achievement award.

RICH REWARDS  
It is the duty of a leader to richly reward those people who provide them service. Doing so shows the wealth of the leader & the community, encourages loyalty & effort in all who witness it, & provides material for the gift-giving economy, since the receiver of the treasure will pass some of it on to their retainers & even to their liege, as proof of their success in foreign lands & to show gratitude for being allowed to embark on such endeavors.
Such rewards will be in proportion to the Hero’s fame, the nature of the service done & the generosity of the community leader(s). The table below gives a modifier to the Hero’s ProfBonus in pounds of silver.
For example, destroying the Monster for a generous leader would provide a reward of 18£ for a Hero with a +3 ProfBonus.
Some leaders can be influenced & either made more (or less) benevolent based on the Hero’s social encounter with them, or, more simply, the Hero’s overall behavior.
While measured in pounds of silver, the actual rewards come in a variety of different pieces of treasure, plus a handful of coins. If your Player likes to document the exact nature of what they receive, use the Treasure Rewards tables on page 139 to determine the details.

| Service           | Miserly | Average | Generous |
| ----------------- | ------- | ------- | -------- |
| Monster destroyer | 2x      | 4x      | 6x       |
| Monster ran off   | 1x      | 2x      | 4x       |
| Other service     | 0.5x    | 1x      | 2x       |

Scaling Rewards  
As Gamemaster, you’ll want to keep an eye on the amount of rewards being distributed & also the Hero’s regular expenditures. A Hero with an average 5 Followers with five gifts each is spending 3-4£ on Follower rewards & 2-3£ on ship maintenance; a Hero with fifteen Followers each with 6 gifts & an upgraded ship might pay 22-24£ on Follower rewards & 8£ on ship maintenance. You’ll want to vary the types of leaders & extra opportunities to make sure that the Hero keeps sailing the Whale Road.

The Monster’s Hoard  
Depending on the Monster, it is possible that the creature possessed treasure, often things from long ago. While the coins minted by the giants are of limited use (only possessing the value of their metal in most cases) other items may be of greater worth. A Monster’s hoard is the perfect place for a Hero to find a piece of magical wargear or other special item.
A Monster’s hoard is also an ideal way to help explain the Monster’s history & origins. Especially if the Monster does not speak, what the Hero finds in its lair can reveal its nature. Broken chains & bars tell of imprisonment (probably justified) while a creature that sleeps near to the graves of its ancestors might have been driven by profound loss & loneliness.
The following table lists monsters by type & gives some idea of how much treasure (use the multiplier given times the Monster’s challenge rating) might be in the hoard. It also provides a chance to roll 1d8, if the given value comes up then there is at least 1 magical item in the hoard. Note that you should only make rolls for those creatures who are likely to possess such items. For example, a Galdre might well have a hoard & a magic item, but a group of Hrēoplingas likely has neither.

| Monster Type | Treasure | Magic(d8) |
| ------------ | -------- | --------- |
| Ceorlcund    | 2x       | 6+        |
| Deofol       | 1x       | 7+        |
| Eotenas      | 3x       | 8+        |
| Firas        | 2x       | 8+        |
| Gigantas     | 2x       | 7+        |
| Gryrefugol   | 2x       | 8+        |
| Mererunan    | 3x       | 8+        |
| Oreneas      | 5x       | 7+        |
| Wildeor      | --       | --        |
| Wyrmas       | 4x       | 6+        |
| Wyrmeynnes   | 6x       | 5+        |

You can use the rules on page 138 & on to generate details for treasures & magic items.

Special Treasures  
Either a leader’s vault or a Monster’s hoard might contain 1 or more special treasures, things whose value exceeds strict monetary measurements. For example, the horses that Hrothgar gives Beowulf (those that he may pass on to Hygelac & Hygd) would count as a special treasure, since trained warhorses are worth more than their normal market price.
Special treasures can come in the form of wargear that has 1 or more gifts, normal gear that has at least 1 gift, a ship with a gift, or a valuable animal (such as a dog, falcon or hawk, or horse), especially 1 with a gift. See the Equipment chapter, starting on page 58.

Practical Regifting  
Beowulf receiving the horses from Hrothgar & then gifting them to his own king & queen seems utterly practical from the point of view of a Hero wandering the Whale-road. He can’t transport horses all the time on his ship (at least his return to Geatland was quick & unchallenged) & a land-bound king has more need of warhorses for his knights than a seaborne Hero.
Future expansions to BEOWULF will provide information on the responsibilities & challenges of rulers (after all, Beowulf does sit on the throne for quite some time) but for now the focus is on Heroes & their wanderings. A generous GM may allow the transfer of such ungainly gifts to happen ‘off-screen’ during downtime & not trouble the Player with such concerns. Unless, of course, getting 4 warhorses & their gear back to your leader’s hall is fated to be an exciting adventure.

Magical Items  
The hoard of the Monster provides an exceptional opportunity for a magical item to appear & for the Hero to claim that item. Of course, very few folk inside the adventure story would call a magical item by so bland a name. Instead it is a piece of battle gear with a legendary history, perhaps 1 that traces back to Weland the smith at the dawn of time, an extraordinary piece of jewelry made by the dweorhas (dwarfs), a clever device of the giants, or a rune-scored talisman of power made by the ancients. Some magic items are not items at all, but otherworldly creatures with remarkable powers or knowledge.
It is possible that the magic item will be discovered over the course of the adventure & might be part of how the Monster itself will be defeated instead of a reward afterwards. Sometimes a magic item might only be on loan to the Hero & must be returned to its rightful owner. Such items don’t count towards the rewards that the Hero receives, of course. A magic item that the Hero can keep is compensation beyond any weight of silver & should usually count as the majority of the reward given. Generating & improving magical items is covered in Part 5, starting on page 138.

FOLLOWERS, CREW & OTHERS  
Once the Hero has received their reward from the leaders present, it is time for them to pass on some of those riches to those that aided them on their quest. The crew’s base compensation is included in the monthly ship maintenance cost (see page 75). If you pay at least a shilling more per crew member (usually a dozen) then the ship gains the loyal crew gift. The Followers must also be compensated, see page 86 for details.
**Loyal Crew**: When a challenge indicates the loss of a Follower, you can choose 1 of the crew to die instead. The crew then loses this gift.

BETWEEN ADVENTURES  
It is possible that word of another danger might reach the Hero’s ears just as they conclude their business with the prior Monster but even the boldest Hero might tire of constant activity after a while. In fact, it’s quite appropriate to require a certain amount of rest, relaxation & reflection before awarding a new level to a Hero.

Downtime  
When a Hero takes downtime, the most important factor is if the downtime is at home (the Hero’s home kingdom) or away. Some Heroes may not have a home kingdom (or it is too far away or other obstacles prevent them from returning). Many of these Heroes will still have an adopted home -- some leader who trusts them well enough to allow them to stay in their hall without question or complaint & will welcome them & their Followers with open arms.
A Hero at home can undertake any of the following activities, paying only the cost given for the activity.
A Hero taking downtime away from home can stay somewhere else for up to 4 weeks without additional cost. After this, their Followers begin to grumble & their host’s hospitality may be wearing thin. The Hero must pay a shilling for themselves & a pence for each Follower for each day of downtime after the 1st 4-weeks. These payments include spending money on supplies directly but also recognizing their host’s continued generosity. The crew is included in the Hero’s expenditures.

Recuperation  
You can use downtime between adventures to recover from a debilitating injury, disease, or poison. After a week recuperating, you can make a CON:15 Save. On a successful save, you can choose 1 of the following results:  
- End 1 effect on you that prevents you from regaining HP.  
- For the next 24 hours, gain +Adv on Saves vs 1 disease or poison currently affecting you.

Research  
While many halls along the Whale Road store their knowledge in the songs of their scops, there are places where knowledge has been recorded -- written codices & scrolls waiting in the abbeys founded by the giants, places where runestones rest or tapestries hang, or in the tales of the old folk.
When you begin your research, the GM determines whether the information is available, how many weeks of downtime it will take to find it, & whether there are any restrictions on your research (such as needing to seek out a specific individual, tome, or location). The GM might also require you to make 1 or more ability checks, such as an Investigation check to find clues pointing toward the information you seek, or a Persuade check to secure someone’s aid. Once those conditions are met, you learn the information if it is available.
For each week of research, you must spend 1 shilling to cover your expenses. This cost is in addition to your normal expenses (if any).

Shipwork  
One problem that can keep a Hero away from home is a ship that needs repairs. For ambitious Heroes ship improvements can be just as pressing. If the location has the proper facilities, the Hero can spend the money & time necessary for a repair or improvement. See the ship burdens & gifts, starting on page 75.

Smithwork  
A Hero might choose to commission a new piece of superior wargear. To do so, they must pay a fee equal to 2x the normal weapon’s cost (for example, a great spear would cost 4£ & a sword would cost 10£) & spend downtime equal to 1 week, plus 1 week for each £ of its cost (rounding up as needed).
The Hero can make a Intimidation:15 or Persuasion:15 check to lower the price. On a success the cost is reduced by 10% or by 20% if the Hero succeeds by 5 or more. If the Hero fails the check by 5 or more however then the cost is increased by 10% as the smith ‘suddenly remembers’ some esoteric aspect of the work.
At the end of the downtime, the Hero receives the new piece of wargear with a single gift of their choice.

Training  
You can spend time between adventures learning a new language or training with a set of tools. First, you must find an instructor willing to teach you. The GM determines how long it takes, & whether 1 or more ability checks are required.  
The training lasts for 30 weeks & costs 1 shilling per week. After you spend the requisite amount of time & money, you learn the new language or gain proficiency with the new tool.

Player Journals  
The conclusion of an adventure often means the end of a session as well. If your Player is interested in journaling for their Followers (see next page) during the time before the next session then this is an excellent time to have a conversation about the process.
You’ll want to set some clear explanations for what journaling will allow -- some GMs might just provide bonus XP to the Hero, while others will allow the addition of new temporary gifts or burdens, or even turning a permanent burden or gift into a temporary 1 as results.
The normal process of adding or removing gifts or burdens is discussed on page 88. The next section covers the journaling process in depth.

THE HERO’S FATE  
This may be a good time to reflect on the Hero’s larger story as well. Some Players will happily slay Monsters until there are no more between the 2 seas. Others might want a bit of variety, every once in a while facing off against mortal foes or perhaps dealing with their own leaders with a visit to their homeland. Some may wish to achieve other goals & future supplements will support that. & some may be ready to pass on their wargear to a new warrior & retire into a life of peace & reflection.
Be sure to touch base with your Player & make sure that you’re providing them with the sorts of adventures that keep them excited about the world of BEOWULF.

PLAYER JOURNALS
Between adventures, the GM will be busy preparing a new story for the Player & perhaps helping to adjudicate the downtime activities of the Hero. But what about the Followers & the Player. Are there things they can be doing to help build out the world of BEOWULF?
This chapter introduces optional rules for Player-facing activities to help develop the game world, mostly by focusing on Followers & their backstories. As Followers develop, they can even ‘graduate’ into becoming Heroes themselves, which might then become available as a new character for the Player to use. However, if the Player is not interested in journaling or exploring the setting then these rules can be safely ignored. The basic rules for advancing Followers can still be used & there is no major difference in mechanical effect, Followers will just advance at a slightly slower pace (or you can allow the number of improvements to be 1+Hero’s ProfB & keep the same pace).

Journal Sessions  
The Player can do 1 journaling session between adventures, unless the Gamemaster allows them to do additional sessions. Nominally the journaling counts as part of the reward stage, though it is often completed after the rest of it. It’s fine for the Player to just note ‘I will also do journals for Hengsk (an active Follower) & Berta (a new possible Follower)’.

THE HERO JOURNAL  
Players can choose to keep a journal of their Hero, recording each adventure, along with their feelings & reactions to those events. These journal entries can also help highlight what the Hero found most interesting, providing hints to the Gamemaster about future sessions. The structure & length of the Hero journal is up to the Player.
Gamemasters might want to encourage Hero journaling by giving the character an Advancement XP checkmark or level-appropriate Meeting XP, depending on what experience system you’re using. See page 129 for details.

ACTIVE FOLLOWER JOURNALS  
Instead of just following the regular rules on page 88 for Improving Followers, a Player that does journaling gets an additional improvement choice. Just like the regular improvement choices, you can add a new temporary gift, transform an existing temporary gift into a permanent one, or turn a permanent burden into a temporary one. In order to do this, you (the Player) write a short narrative about that Follower & what happened to cause that improvement action.
The rules for the narrative are simple: you can’t involve other Followers or the Hero, except as brief appearances, only the current Follower experiences change or growth over the course of the narrative & you don’t write anything contradicting the established information of the game world.

Follower Events  
If you are stumped for a way that the Follower may have made a change, you can pick from or roll on the table below, which might inspire an idea for the narrative.

Event Affecting the Follower
| 1d6 | 1                | 2                                  | 3                | 4                  |
| --- | ---------------- | ---------------------------------- | ---------------- | ------------------ |
| 1   | A family member  | asks for your help with            | a missing/broken | bit of knowledge   |
| 2   | A mentor         | charges you with a crime regarding | a personal       | leader/ruler       |
| 3   | An old flame     | has cheated/tricked you regarding  | a secret/hidden  | magic/special item |
| 4   | A rival          | makes a generous offer for         | a treacherous    | promise/oath       |
| 5   | A stranger       | sells/gives you news of            | a unique         | relationship       |
| 6   | Another follower | wishes to hear an old story about  | a valuable       | treasure           |

NEW FOLLOWER JOURNALS  
In addition to advancing an existing Follower, you can also spend your time journaling about a new potential Follower. You can make 1 change to this Follower each time you have a Journaling session. If you give this Follower a burden (and did not give any other Followers a burden during the reward stage) then you can add a temporary gift in addition to your 1st improvement choice.
It is the Gamemaster’s discretion where the new potential Follower will be made available & when. You should work with the GM when you’re interested in introducing the Follower.

Followers on their Own  
If there are 1 or more Followers that the Hero has met & failed to recruit, you can also use the above table & a Player journal to keep track of what they’ve been up to & when the Hero might get another chance to recruit them. Work with the GM to make sure that any reunions make sense in the shared story.

Player-created Followers  
As a Gamemaster it might seem unusual for the Player to be creating NPCs. However, this is part of the benefit of duet style play -- you want your 1 & only Player to be able to connect with (and find valuable) the various NPCs, especially Followers. By having the Player create some of them, you’re more likely to find success here. Always try to be fair to the Player’s potential Followers & introduce them as soon as it’s reasonable -- after all, they’ve been waiting in the wings for a while.

WORLDBUILDING  
As you write about your Hero & your Followers, you will (perhaps inadvertently) do some measure of creating the setting as well as the characters. Coordinate with the Gamemaster to make sure that you do not invalidate each other’s ideas. It may be that the GM will want to ‘assign’ certain areas of the setting to your care, to serve as homelands & background locations for your Followers. Remember that the world of BEOWULF is home to many tiny, fractious kingdoms. 1 of your Followers might leave their home hall to travel only a few days in any direction in order to find a completely different land, complete with a strange longhouse & strange rulers with strange ideas. The world is vast & even what we would now consider short distances are enough to separate various folk.
One particularly remarkable way to play BEOWULF is for the Player & Gamemaster to take turns in each other’s roles. So you might journal as a Player about a specific place, & then have your partner’s Hero visit that location when it’s your turn to be Gamemaster. Then they might journal about it as well, the 2 of you creating a tapestry woven of many elements.

APPRENTICE HEROES  
When a Follower departs because they’ve achieved enough gifts (see page 88) they become a apprentice Hero -- they’re almost ready to be an actual Hero but just need a little final consideration.
A Player can choose to write a special series of journals to transform the apprentice into a ready-to-play Hero. You might do this if you want to have another Hero exploring the Whale Road in a different direction, or if you’re about to retire a Hero (or worried that they will soon meet their match in deadly combat).

The 1st Journal -- History  
The 1st entry is about the history of the Follower & their previous experiences. You’ll choose an appropriate Background for the Hero (the Sidekick background is always available but you can also dig deeper into the former Follower’s personal history) & take either an appropriate quirk from the table or transform one of their gifts into a new quirk.
This journal should be all about the previous experiences of the apprentice & congeal elements like their alignment, personality traits, ideals, bonds & flaws.

The 2nd Journal -- Ambition  
The 2nd journal for the prospective Hero should be focused on how they will achieve their ultimate goals. By interpreting the remaining gifts & burdens you should determine which of the six different tales is most appropriate for the apprentice & make connections between their old life & their new one.
Note that their old Follower gifts & burdens begin to fade as they train to be a Hero, their new features taking their place. You should make a conscious effort to have the nature of their tale become evident by their capabilities or goals.

The 3rd Journal -- Tempering  
The last entry completes the transition from Follower to Hero. Part of this journal should reflect the Follower’s feelings about becoming a Hero & their new responsibilities. You should use information from the other journals & the Follower’s card to determine their equipment & wargear, plus any remaining details for the new Hero character. 
As the apprentice completes their training, the last journal should provide some hints as to their abilities & features & what sort of Hero they have become.

The End of One Road  
Once you’ve completed the 3rd journal, go ahead & fill out the new Hero’s character sheet. You have now created a new Lv1 Hero to begin adventuring on the Whale Road.

TREASURE  
In BEOWULF, treasure is measured in pounds of silver (£). The economy of the Whale Road is a mixed & mythic one, composed of coinage, bartering, gift-giving & lordly patronage. We use pounds of silver as a convenient way for players, as denizens of the modern world, to assign consistent value to a wide variety of goods, & focus on the work of a Hero rather than the specifics of barter.
Heroes have regular need to reward their Followers & maintain their wargear & ship, so almost every adventure will provide them with a certain amount of silver as a reward, along with other objects which might found along the way.The GM should keep a close eye on how much silver a Hero needs to maintain their Followers & Ship, & make decisions on how much treasure to make available & precisely how it can be won accordingly.
Most treasure hoards will contains coins & treasures of a more varied type.This section will help define the various valuable objects a Hero might encounter on their adventures in addition to coins.
Coins themselves might well come from all around the Whale Road, featuring the mysterious names, faces & symbols of various kings who have had those coins struck. Some might well come from more ancient times, & lost peoples. Others come from more distant lands to the south & east, brought by traders & travelers. Even a pile of coins can tell a tale or provide the opening to an adventure.
The precise value of any individual object is largely up to the GM - a finely-inscribed comb of walrus ivory might be as valuable as a golden cross. Any item of non-magical treasure can be worth any number of £ of silver, depending on the quality of its make. Most treasure items range from 1-3£.
When creating non-magical treasure items there are 3 concerns of which to be mindful:  
- A range of thematic treasure items is atmospheric & enhances the heroic feel of the setting more than piles of coins can.  
- Too many highly-detailed descriptions of pieces of treasure are hard to absorb & boring to listen to. Describing some key, interesting items is great, & making up the rest in simple arm rings, neck rings & brooches each worth 1£ does the trick.  
- The ability to “spend” the item (or not) is significant. A piece of treasure worth 1£ can be easily given to a Follower as a reward, or readily traded for coins. A single item worth a large amount of £ starts to stretch credulity if it is broken up & “spent” as easily as a 1£ item.

MAGICAL TREASURES  
This section presents a number of magical artefacts that a Hero might come to own in the course of their voyages. It also gives the Gamemaster tools to reliably create their own magical treasures for the Hero to find.
These are divided into various categories to help Gamemasters navigate the options, but be aware that these categories might not be known to the people who actually live in the Age of Heroes.
The items listed here are by no means exhaustive, & due to the magic of the 5th Edition rules, it is possible to add a Whale Road flavor to most magic items found elsewhere, perhaps using the forms given here as inspiration.
In the absence of player character spellcasters in this setting, & with just 1 player character, such items are very precious indeed. Talismans & amulets are a common form of folk magic, especially among Heroes, & after a few adventures it is likely every Hero will have a few of these to fall back on. Regardless of their potency, magical treasures are always unique & often sacred possessions, or else they are hidden, legendary treasures that only the very bold could ever hope to possess.
Heroes are not sorcerers or spell-singers. Their knowledge of matters mystical is usually rather limited & practical, & so most of these magical treasures are of a simple, straightforward nature. They are precious, & they “do a thing”, so that they sit comfortably in the hands of a Hero, & do not require expert research or arcane knowledge. Magical treasures in the Age of Heroes are fantastical but folksy.
To aid the Gamemaster & to keep items unique to each Hero’s story, this section provides a menu of options for each treasure, with suggestions for its physical form appropriate to the setting, along with suggested powers that make a worthy treasure.

TALISMANS  
Talismans are small magical items which can be carried around the person, be it worn on a thong around the neck, hung from a belt or stowed in a pouch. Talismans are intended to ward off malign influences, bring good luck, or aid in a particular endeavor.
They are relatively common amongst Heroes, who seek out such means of protection & help. They are generally of a lower order of mystical power than amulets.
Most Heroes can spot that a talisman is more than a common piece of jewelry, but it might take a specialized sage or wise person to reveal the full extent of a talisman’s powers, although talismans do not require attunement.

A talisman might take any of the following forms (1d8): 
1. A pierced coin showing warriors & or monsters
2. A ring made of metal or wood
3. A small figure carved in wood, antler, or bone, or cast in metal
4. A fragment of an ancient cremation urn carved with runes
5. A brooch, made of antler, bone, or precious metal
6. A carved disc on a thong made of bone, antler or wood
7. A metal medallion or pendant
8. A pierced shell

It is possible that a talisman might have more than 1 power, but this is rare. Typically a talisman can be used 1/day. A talisman might have 1 of the following powers (1d12):  
1. 1/day, as a bonus action, the talisman may be used to gain +1 Inspiration.
2. 1/day, as a bonus action, the talisman may be used & until the start of your next turn, any critical hits against you are considered normal hits.
3. 1/day, as a bonus action, the talisman may be used to provide +Adv on a specific skill check.
4. 1/day when the bearer fails a skill check they gain +1 Inspiration
5. 1/day when the bearer takes damage they gain +1 Inspiration
6. 1/day when the bearer fails a Save they gain +1 Inspiration
7. 1/day when the bearer fails a Save they gain +1d4 HP per ProfBonus.
8. 1/day, as a bonus action, this talisman may be used to cause another talisman to be useable an additional time per day.
9. 1/day, spend -1 Inspiration to gain +Adv on Persuade checks for 1 minute while in possession of this talisman.
10. 1/day, spend -1 Inspiration to gain +Adv on Stealth checks for 1 minute while in possession of this talisman.
11. 1/day, spend -1 Inspiration to gain +Adv on Investigation checks for 1 minute while in possession of this talisman.
12. 1/day, spend -1 Inspiration to gain +Adv on Saves vs poison damage for 1 minute while in possession of this talisman.

The power of a talisman can be activated in a number of different different ways (1d8):  
1. By invoking an Old Gods name or the God of the Book
2. By offering a silent prayer to the God of the Book
3. By swearing an oath
4. By making a loud declaration
5. By rubbing it
6. By holding it aloft
7. By squeezing it in your hand

Every talisman has a story, even if it is a mysterious one. Its appearance usually relates in some way to its powers, & a talisman almost always has a name. Such backstories might even provide future adventure hooks, or ideas for player journaling.

**Example Talisman**  
_The Monster Shilling of Dinys Edin_  
From the North of Northumbria, this ancient, verdigris’d coin, pierced & hung on a leather thong, shows a fierce & hideous monster, grimacing as it is impaled by spears. Is it Woden? Is it a progeny of Cain? No 1 knows. 1/day when the bearer takes damage they gain Inspiration.

AMULETS  
Amulets for the purpose of categorization are small items, worn around the neck or hung from a belt, which are more powerful than talismans. Amulets may have charges, or limited uses per given time period. Just like a talisman, an amulet can be recognized by a Hero as ‘special’ but not necessarily immediately identified. They may need help with uncovering the true powers of an amulet, & all amulets require attunement.

An amulet might take any of the following forms (1d10):  
1. Sprigs of dried flowers or woody herbs (especially where charges are used)
2. A carved bead of jet, amethyst or amber
3. A short length of ivory or wood carves with runes
4. A piece of sanctified cloth
5. Ancient worked flint
6. A stone shell (a fossil)
7. An oak, birch or yew ball
8. A crystal sphere mounted in precious metal
9. A pierced human bone
10. An enameled & inlayed pendant or medallion

It is possible that an amulet might have more than 1 power, but this is rare. Greater amulets have stronger powers, & have their own list. An amulet might have 1 of the following powers (1d10):  
1. The wearer is immune to disease.
2. The wearer is immune to poison damage & the Poisoned condition.
3. When wearing this amulet, you have a dark vision range of 60ft.
4. Gain +1HP/Lv while in possession of this item.

8. You gain +Adv on Saves vs poison damage while in possession of this item.
9. 1/day the wearer may spend -1 Inspiration to cause a Spent Follower to become unspent.

A greater amulet might have 1 of the following powers (1d12):  
1. While in possession of this item you may ignore difficult terrain.

3. While in possession of this item you can jump 3x your normal distance.

7. While in possession of this amulet you have resistance to 1 type of damage: acid, cold, fire, force, lightning, necrotic, poison, psychic, radiant or thunder.

10. While in possession of this amulet your (chosen Stat) is increased by 1/2/3 (max 3) while wearing this item.
11. While in possession of this amulet, use an action & expend 1 or more charges to heal wounds (1 charge per 1d8 of healing) The item regains 1d3 charges daily at dawn (optionally, at the discretion of the GM)

**Story of Magical Treasure**  
Discovering, winning & possessing magical treasures that have a story woven into the places & peoples of the Whale Road really helps the Player feel like a mythic hero, & reinforces the atmosphere of the setting. There are no simple +1 swords in BEOWULF: they are all unique artefacts with a story which someone, somewhere knows, & which the Hero might uncover. This might be simply background detail & stage-setting. Or it might provide a reward of experience. It might even add additional qualities & powers to an artefact once its whole story is known. It might even unlock the riddle of defeating a Monster.

So how might a Hero find out more?
The most straight-forward way is for an NPC to tell the tale of the object before the Hero finds it, making it an object worth seeking out, or 1 that is recognized by the Hero when they later discover it.
A mysterious treasure might also be found without any foreknowledge of its name or tale. A Hero can usually discern if an object seems to be of importance, & they may well go looking for answers. Whether they are told ahead of time, or after discovering an object, such a tale might be related by a wise woman brewing her medicines, a travelling scop entertaining the longhouse, a local noble who has always wondered where the treasure is hidden in their kingdom, a Follower who heard the tale as a youth, a monk poring over their texts, or a child singing an old rhyme as the Hero passes by.

Even more than talismans, every amulet has a story. Its appearance usually relates in some way to its powers, & an amulet always has a name. Here's some examples:  
1. It was made by the giants.
2. It was dropped by an old god.
3. It was made by the ancients.
4. It was blessed by the Savior.
5. It was made by a saint.
6. It was made by a wise woman.
7. It was made by a dwarf.
8. It was made in far away Pictland/Denmark/the burning lands to the far south beyond the Forest.
9. An elf gave it to an ancestor.
10. While in possession of this amulet, once a day you may make your shield invulnerable to splintering for the next 10 minutes.
11. While in possession of this amulet, once a day you may make your helmet invulnerable to splintering for the next 10 minutes.
12. While in possession of this amulet, 1 Stat of your choice is increased by +1 (max 3).
13. While in possession of this item you may are immune to the Stunned condition

**Example Amulet**  
_A Sprig of Mugwort Comeliness_  
This amulet has 3 charges, which cannot be recharged. Expend a charge by using your action to proudly show off the amulet in order to gain +Adv on your next Persuade check while in possession of this item. Mugwort is a well-known magical herb, & if prepared correctly can prove very effective in enhancing the attractiveness of any who wear it in their cloak-pin.

MAGICAL WEAPONS & ARMOR  
In the world of BEOWULF, weapons & armor have several qualities which might make them superior & worthy of a Hero. The boundaries between such wargear being very old, very well made, culturally significant, & magical are often blurred. Weapons & armor might possess 1 or more of the following qualities, up to a maximum of 4. Such weapons almost always have a story, which is either known in the region in which it is found, or can be uncovered later.

**Pattern-welded Swords, Shivs, Spears, Javelins & Axes**  
Most weapons are created with some level of pattern welding, due to the poverty of iron available in this age of the world. However, master-worked pattern welded weapons are exemplary examples of this technique & have prodigious strength, flexibility & enduring sharpness.
Any edged weapon considered worthy of the name pattern-welded in a tale will have the characteristic smoke, herringbone or snake patterns running along its blade.
Any pattern-welded blade confers +1 to hit, & +1 to damage, & the weapon is considered magical, such is the skill of its manufacture. A pattern welded weapon may have other qualities which raise these bonuses, & they are considered cumulative.

**Named, Ancestor & Barrow Weapons & armor**  
A weapon which has been given a name which has become widely known, or which has been owned by ancient ancestors, or has been found in a barrow or ancestor grave, provides +1 to hit, & +1 to damage for that weapon, & the weapon is considered magical. The benefits of such Named, Ancestor or Barrow weapons & armor can be applied to other types of magical weapons & armor & the bonuses are considered cumulative.

**Rune-scribed weapons & armor**  
A weapon which has been scribed with mysterious runes provides +1 to hit, & +1 to damage for a weapon, & that weapon is considered magical. Rune-scribed armors provide +1 to armor Class, & the armor is considered magical. Rune-scribing can be applied to other types of magical weapons & armor & the bonuses are considered cumulative.

**Dwarf-made Weapons & armor**  
Weapons & armor of any type which appear to be of exceptional quality are often referred to as “Dwarf-made”. A Dwarf-made weapon deals an additional amount of damage =ProfBonus. A Dwarf-made armor adds additional points of AC=half ProfBonus (round down). Dwarfs never make light armor & rarely make anything other than heavy armor.

**Example Magical Weapon**  
_Westenweag, Rune-scribed Ancient Barrow Langseax_  
This Langseax of great age was taken from a barrow in time out of mind. It possesses a smoke patterned blade of slender & wicked curves, & an undulating edge of prodigious sharpness. Scribed along its length is the name Westenweag, which mean the Wave of the West. It also bears the line:  
“A faithful hearth-troop, oath-fated, a shield & shelter to their lord”  
Legend tells that Westenwaeg was forged from iron found in the Vale of Glamorgan. As a named, pattern-welded, barrow-sword Westenwaeg is considered magical & gains +3 to hit & +3 to damage.

GIFTED WEAPONS  
An heirloom, or well-thought-of weapon can make for an impressive gift. The giving of such finely made gifts reflects honor on the giver & the receiver, binding them to 1 another.  
Such weapons generally have +1 to hit or +1 to damage. They are very finely made weapons, but the damage dealt is not considered magical.

**Naming Weapons & Armor**  
The people of the Whale Road really enjoy alliteration, & for them it holds power. So a good name will often be alliterative. Weapons & armor also have certain cultural qualities that are often reflected in their names.  
It is possible to construct thematic sounding names by twinning 2 words: so “hard-head”or “swift-shaft’. Often, but not always these are firstly an adjective, then a noun.

Example 1st Words (1d20):
1. hard
2. smoke
3. bone
4. war
5. board
6. hard-filed
7. butcher
8. death
9. sharp
10. fire
11. swift
12. wound
13. fierce
14. god
15. skull
16. joyful
17. blood
18. battle
19. woden

Example 2nd Words (1d30):
1. shaft
2. finger
3. flame
4. breaker
5. husband
6. hound
7. raven
8. head
9. giver
10. lightning
11. seeker
12. flood
13. hart
14. wolf
15. blade
16. taker
17. storm
18. board (for a shield)
19. harvest
20. bird
21. boar
22. hand
23. maker
24. biter
25. wife
26. reaver
27. crow
28. bear

These words work well when translated into Old English, to give more mysterious-sounding names. The Anglo-Saxons also reveled in kennings, & research into these poetic euphemisms provides endless inspiration for the names of treasures.
Weapons & armor might also have names in Old English that reflect what they do: “Hrunting”, the named sword in the poem Beowulf means “thrusting”.“Naegling” means “nailing”, or “hole maker”.
In other, broadly related works, we see swords that are dedicated to a particular god or powerful legendary figure, like: 
- the sword Mimung, which means “dedicated to Mime”  
- the teacher of Weyland, the Smith who forged the sword.

Sadly, providing a complete Old English dictionary is beyond the scope of this book, but many user-friendly examples are available. Check the reading list at the back of this book.

ADDITIONAL WARGEAR QUALITIES  
Magical wargear might also possess abilities which do not have a mechanical impact but do add to its wonder (1d10):  
1. never rusts
2. is always sharp
3. never bends or breaks
4. always gleams
5. has a mystical origin
6. is made from a special kind of material, like star iron
7. was made by a legendary smith
8. was quenched or hardened in an unusual material: blood
9. has a rainbow sheen
10. has snake or smoke pattern

HEALING TREASURES  
Herbs, salves, medicines & potions are made by exceptional individuals. There are no shops or stalls that sell this kind of healing, & it is always unique to the maker.
The knowledge to make such items is rare, & keenly sought after. Those with the skill keep them closely guarded, & whether they are found in a remote abbey, or hidden sacred grove deep in the Forest, such goods are to be treasured & only used at great need.
Gaining such items might require the performance of service to a local ruler, an offer of protection to a remote monastery, or the isolated creator of the healing goods. They might be discovered as rewards for slaying a Monster, or discovered in a unique location along the way.

Such healing goods might take 1 of the following forms (1d8):  
1. A bunch of fresh herbs
2. A bundle of dried herbs bound with twine
3. A salve made of goose or swan fat
4. A brew made with herbs & fermented pine needles
5. A honey sweetened fermented milk drink
6. A thick, unpleasant-looking paste wrapped in birch bark
7. A clear liquid that tastes of metal, kept in an ancient glass vessel

It might have any 1 of the following effects (1d4):  
1. You may use your action to apply, drink, or give 1 dose of the medicine. The recipient gains 1d4+2 HP.
2. You may use your action to apply, drink, or give 1 dose of the medicine. The recipient gains 2d8+2 HP.
3. You may use your action to apply, drink, or give 1 dose of the medicine. The recipient ceases to be poisoned.
4. You may use your action to apply, drink, or give 1 dose of the medicine. The recipient is cured of any disease

Special healing treasures might be found that might come in useful when given to a Follower:
- Cause a Follower to become Unspent  
- Give a Follower a temporary Gift  
- Cause a Follower’s Engage Gift to last +1 extra round

**Example Potion**  
_The Witchbrew of Mistlemarch_  
This carved yew-wood bottle with antler stopper contains a thick, milky brew. It smells faintly of pine-needles & mistletoe. When drunk by a Follower it allows them to use their Engage gift for 1 extra round. If drunk by anyone else it has the following effect (1d4):  
1. The imbiber feels faintly nauseous, but otherwise suffers no effects.  
2. The imbiber feels highly nauseous, & gains the Poisoned condition.  
3. The imbiber gains 1d4 HP up to their maximum.  
4. The imbiber feels fantastic & gains +1 Inspiration

CURING STONES  
Curing stones are magical artefacts which can heal specific ills. Curing stones can be made by Dwarfs, or Elf-magic, or by wise-folk of ancient times, or left scattered across creation for the mighty & faithful by God. No 1 really knows for sure. They usually take the form of a rock, crystal or pebble, clearly possessing some kind of mysterious power. Curing stones are held against the injured party, & concentrated upon. Their magic cures wounds, poison or disease, depending on the particulars of the stone. All curing stones require attunement.

Curing stones might take any of the following forms, any of which might be carved with ancient designs or magical runes (1d5):  
1. A river-worn pebble with unusual striations
2. A carved lobe of granite
3. A fist-sized block of black amber
4. A ball of amber containing preserved flies
5. An oval of flint

A curing stone will have 1 of the following powers; 1/day spend -1 Inspiration to (1d8): 
1. Restore 1d3HP per level of the bearer
2. Restore 1d4HP per level of the bearer
3. Restore 1d6HP per level of the bearer
4. Remove the Poisoned condition
5. Remove the Blinded condition
6. Cure any disease
7. Gain +10 TempHP, which last 1 hour

**Example Curing Stone**  
_The Honey Scopstone_  
A rounded, oval chunk of baltic amber, the honey Scopstone sits easily in the palm of a hand & is warm to touch. Curiously, trapped inside the stone is what appears to be a desiccated white butterfly.  
1/day, anyone holding the Scopstone & spending -1 Inspiration regains 1d3HP/Lv.

TREASURES OF THE BOOK, HOARDS OF THE OLD GODS  
There are in the world, certain magical treasures that require a specific philosophical alignment to use or gain benefit, as the owner or wielder. These items can only be use by Heroes of the specific alignment connected to the item. Neutral Heroes can only use items of the Church or the Old Ways that correspond to their current alignment die. (See page 28 for more information on alignment). Only Neutral Heroes can gain the effects of specifically Neutral items. All of these items require attunement.

Treasures of the Church  
The church is the source of many relics & sanctified goods which can be of aid & inspiration to the faithful. Carried as symbols of faith, & as warnings to the enemies of God, such objects reflect the nature of the God of the Book. These are most often either prayed over to receive a blessing from above, or boldly presented to foes of God to achieve their effects. Some of these treasures work directly, as if they directly hold wondrous power. Others function by way of inspiring the owner to greater resilience or moral strength.

A Treasure of the Church might take 1 of the following forms (1d8):  
1. Illuminated pages of the gospel on vellum
2. A clay tablet inscribed with an acrostic Lord’s Prayer
3. A highly decorated gold reliquary containing a relic of saints
4. A very simple or humble reliquary containing a relic of a saint
5. A relic of saints such as a finger bone, thigh bone, or pieces of shroud
6. A decorated cross, engraved with scripture
7. A book containing a series of wise written law codes
8. A book containing a written lineage of kings, dedicated to the Church

A Treasure of the Church might confer 1 of the following effects (1d14):  
1. 1/day, you may spend an action to gain +1 Inspiration.
2. 1/day, you may spend your reaction to gain +Adv on Saves caused by creatures aligned with the Old Ways
3. 1/day, you may spend -1 Inspiration to learn a piece of information relevant to your current adventure.

**Example Treasure of the Church**  
_The Cross of St Cuthbert_  
This inscribed & garnet-studded golden cross stands 18 inches tall, & is mounted on a heavy base of carved stone. On the front of the base is carved an acrostic Lord’s Prayer in Latin.  
1/day, by brandishing the Cross of St Cuthbert as your action, you may spend -1 Inspiration to inflict the Prone condition on all creatures aligned with the Old Ways within 30ft.

**Treasures of the Old Ways**  
The mysterious & secret rites of the Old Ways frequently involve ritual objects, many of which contain power to affect the middle earth of mannish peoples.
The followers of the Old Ways also tend towards a more superstitious bent than those of the Church, putting even more faith in magical objects than the followers of the Church. The Old Gods are known to scatter artefacts across the world to help the mighty battle giants, or simply as things they have grown tired of & have discarded.
There are many different kinds of secret knowledge in the world of the Old Ways, & they manifest themselves in artefacts just as varied as the kinds of Old Ways shrines & temples across the world.

A Treasure of the Old Ways might take the form of (1d8):  
1. A hammer pendant
2. Ogham staves carved into a wooden token or staff
3. A carved, wooden god head
4. A sacred sickle
5. A magical wolf skin
6. A war-horn dedicated to 1 of the Old Gods
7. A carved tablet of stone
8. An antler carved with magical runes

A Treasure of the Old Ways might have 1 or more of the following powers (1d6):  
1. 1/day, you may spend an Action to gain +1 Inspiration
2. Spend -1 Inspiration & your Action to inflict the Prone condition on creatures aligned with the Church within 30ft
3. 1/day, use your Action to call upon the strength of your ancestors & thereby add +1 Inspiration token to the Hero Pool
4. 1/day, use your action to call upon the favor of local spirits, & thereby add +1 Inspiration token to the Follower Pool
5. 1/day, use your action to swear an oath & thereby remove -1 Inspiration token from the GM Pool
6. 1/day you may call upon the battle-wrath of Thunor in order to lower your AC by up to 3 points until the start of your next turn, adding the same number of points to your attack rolls.

**Example treasure of the Old Ways**  
_The Hammer of the Danes_  
This hammer is a heavy golden pendant, stamped with many concentric circle patterns, threaded onto a string of glass & amber beads. Weapon of mighty Thunor, the hammer brings good fortune to all those who cleave close to the Old Ways. 1/Day, use your action to grip the hammer, & add +1 Inspiration token to the Hero Pool.

**Unaligned Treasures**  
There are a number of precious objects in the world that are unaligned with either the Church or the Old Gods, & yet which seem to possess rare power in the world. These might be textual works of great research & knowledge, great artisanship, or simply deeply mysterious objects not understood by any faith held by people. While these can be used by anyone, those of great faith in The Old Ways or the Church may be highly suspicious of them & their origins.

Unaligned treasures might take the form of (1d4):  
1. A leech guide to medicine
2. A map made in curious style from beyond the Whale Road
3. A work calendar - when to plant, when to reap
4. A written history, like (1d6): 
1. The Arrival of Kings
2. A written heroic poem
3. A work on monsters
4. A history which impugns ancient peoples
5. An inscriptions on lead
6. A story of travelers from far-off lands

Such an unaligned treasures might have 1 of the following powers (1d5):  
1. 1/day during a Short Rest you may +ProfBonus to the total number of HP regained.
2. 1/day, gain +Adv on any INT check.
3. 1/day, use your Action to add +1 Inspiration token to the Hero Pool
4. 1/day, use your Action to add +1 Inspiration token to the Follower Pool
5. 1/day, use your Action to remove -1 Inspiration token from the GM Pool

MAGICAL ANIMALS  
A Hero may come to own a magical animal. These are distinct to Noble Animals in that they do not count as Followers, & are far less active as NPCs. Magical animals tend to have above average intelligence for their kind, along with the ability to communicate in a rudimentary way with their owner. Magical animals are not as independently intelligent as a Noble Animal or human Follower.
Magical animals provide some similar effects to magical items, while also being the equivalent of a pet or working animal companion for the Hero. Magical animals are too small & weak to feature in combat. They can be stolen or lost, just like any magic item. It is very unlikely that a magical animal would be killed by an adversary -- they’re too small to be targeted, & too agile to be easily struck. Friendship with a magical animal requires attunement.

Forms Taken (1d6): 
1. small bird, like a mistle-thrush or starling
2. weasel
3. otter
4. mouse
5. snake
6. dog

Effects:  
- 1/day, if they provide a reasonable explanation of what the magical animal does to provide it, the owner may gain +Adv on a skill check. Whether the animal has been able to scout out an area & relay useful information, or provides some kind of warning is up to the owner to describe.  
- 1/day, the company of the animal provides the Hero with +1 Inspiration
- 1/day, whether through comfort & companionship, or magical spittle, the animal provides you with 2d8 HP of healing

**Varying it up**  
Magical treasures should hold a unique place in any Hero’s story. The following information can be used to vary the frequency with which an item can be used, or how long its effects last. The use of an item typically has some kind of cost, be it a charge, or the expenditure of an Action or Inspiration. Where an item has charges, these can vary in amount, & how often they recharge.

Frequency (1d10):
1. Single-use only
2. 1/Adventure
3. 1/Day
4. 1/Long Rest
5. 1/Short Rest
6. for next 10min
7. for next 1min
8. until start of your next turn
9. per charge expended
10. Single-use only

Cost (1d5): 
1. spend -1 Inspiration
2. expend a charge
3. use an action
4. passive effect that works when conditions are met
5. passive effect always active

Charges, where appropriate (1d4):
1. 1d2
2. 1d3
3. 1d2+1
4. 1d3+1

Recharging, where appropriate (1d4): 
1. 1d2-1 at dawn
2. 1d3 at dawn
3. 1d3 per adventure
4. 1d3 per season or year

**MONSTERS**
For BEOWULF: Age of Heroes we have drawn from the poem itself, other contemporary writings & a group of other inspirational sources: we plunder folk & fairy tales that might have been part of the oral traditions for uncounted years, but were only written down within the last 500 years or so. The adventure is a story being told, don’t be afraid to introduce something new & exciting to this retelling.

**FOES & MONSTERS**  
In BEOWULF we distinguish between foes -- the ordinary sorts of monsters & opponents that a Hero faces over the course of a fantasy adventure & Monsters, which are usually singular, nearly-unbeatable enemies that the entire adventure is themed around & are often the ‘final battle’ of the adventure.

**Names**  
Quite a few of the enemies listed here are known by different names, and, sometimes, the ordinary folk in our stories of adventure will be uncertain as to the identity of the creature or conflate 2 different names as meaning the same thing.
In entries we introduce the creature by using a well-attested Old English name (or our best guess for those creatures who are more speculative in nature). We usually then can use a modern English version of that name or another name that has survived in stories we still tell today. Sometimes, we only have 1 name available to us & will use that at all time.
And, of course, in the Beowulf poem the few monsters that appear are often named with many of these categories. We imagine that these serve as similes (or at least metaphors) for the audience; Grendel is not a dēofol, he just shares some characteristics of them.
Some categorisations are necessary for a role-playing game, but it is good to remember the people who inhabit the Deer Sea around The Whale Road have no such dependance on categorisation. A Monster is a Monster.

Foes  
Every enemy listed in this chapter is designed as a foe, in other words, a monster that is part of the story but not its main focus. Foes are defeatable, i.e. they can gain the Defeated condition. So it is unlikely that the Hero or the Followers will need to fight to the death against a foe. Certain classes of foes (for example, Firas, which are human foes) do not have the option to become Monsters.

**Monsters**  
Most of the enemies in this chapter however can become Monsters. To do so, you’ll remove the Defeatable feature from the foe’s stat block & add the Undefeatable gift listed with the rest of the gifts. The enemy’s write-up & notes under Undefeatable gift will give you some suggestions about the Monster & its powers but you can also come up with your own backstory & weakness for the Monster. For help, see the Monster tables starting on page 250.

**ACTIONS, FEATURES & REACTIONS**  
Like ordinary enemies in 5e, each foe has a number of actions (listed under the action header in the stat block), a number of features (listed before the actions) and, possibly, a reaction or 2 (if the base version of the foe has a reaction there will be a header for it in the stat block).

**Burdens & Gifts**  
Adding burdens or gifts to a foe changes it, by either adding or removing features, actions & reactions to the enemy’s stat block. You can make a foe weaker, reducing its challenge rating in order for a lower-level Hero to experience fighting such a creature, or you can make the foe stronger, in order to threaten a higher-level Hero.
To determine the XP for a given challenge rating, you can use the table on page 130 or see the core reference guides.

**Inspiration**  
In BEOWULF, the GM has an Inspiration pool as well. Many foes & Monsters have Gifts that allow them to spend -1 Inspiration in order to do special Actions or Reactions.

**Legendary Actions**  
Certain Monsters can become legendary by taking the appropriate gifts. A legendary creature can do things that ordinary creatures can’t. It can take special actions outside its turn, & it might exert magical influence for miles around.
A legendary creature can take a certain number of special actions -- called legendary actions-- outside its turn. Only 1 legendary action option can be used at a time & only at the end of another creature’s turn. A creature refreshes its legendary actions at the start of its turn. It can forgo using them, & it can’t use them while incapacitated or otherwise unable to take actions. If surprised, it can’t use them until after its 1st turn in the combat.
Foes capable of becoming legendary also have a description of their lair & available lair actions & regional effects if appropriate.

**DEFEATABLE & UNDEFEATABLE**  
While many foes will fight to the death, most foes are optionally defeatable -- a Hero can fulfill some condition that will cause the foe to be defeated, & the foe will not fight to the death, instead following 1 of the behaviors listed below. The stat blocks list some suggested criteria for becoming defeated.

**The Defeated condition**  
Once subject to the Defeated condition a creature may:  
- have its fighting spirit broken & will immediately attempt to flee, never to be seen again  
- surrender to the creature who inflicted the Defeated condition
- become doomed to die from wounds, slinking away never to be seen again  
- be in some way disarmed, or transformed  
- become vulnerable to suggestion or command by a Hero  
- be permanently pinned, imprisoned or immobilized  
- become harmless in some other way the GM invents to fit the circumstances

As a rule of thumb, the majority of mundane foes will simply flee or surrender when subject to the Defeated condition. A Hero can routinely leave surrendered foes to their Followers to manage -- & most often Followers will disarm them & send them on their way. Having been defeated they will not trouble the Hero again.

**Undefeatable**  
Capital-M Monsters are undefeatable, meaning that they take almost no damage from regular attacks & Defeated condition triggers no longer apply. Only Monsters can have the Undefeatable feature & gaining it is what turns a foe into a Monster. Some high-level Heroes can use their abilities to force an undefeatable creature to become defeatable. Most of the time it is up to the Hero to figure out how to remove the Undefeatable feature, & then how to bestow the Defeated condition -- or to simply beat the Monster to death by removing all its HP where that is possible.

**Common Means of Defying Undefeatable**  
This listing provides common ways to remove the undefeatable feature, Monster entries will have custom suggestions as well.. It is entirely possible that a Monster might need more than 1 of these criteria to be met in order to defeat it:  
- **The Right Tool**: The Hero needs to find, craft, steal or otherwise acquire a special weapon created specifically to defeat the Monster.  
- **Soft Underbelly, Slipped Scale**: The Hero must discover knowledge of, & attack, a hidden or secret weak spot.  
- **An Artefact of Woe**: The Hero may need to bring a specific item before the monster, to make it vulnerable to defeat.  
- **True Name**: Discovering the secret true name of a Monster & revealing it sometimes is enough to break its immunity to defeat.  
- **The Right Place at the Right Time**: The Hero may have to engineer a method of bringing the Monster to a specific place, possibly at a specific time, where it loses its undefeatable feature.  
- **Destined Enemy**: The Hero must rouse a special enemy of the Monster to fight it

CEORLCUND  
These creatures might resemble humans but if they were ever of normal stock, they have now been twisted into hideous new forms. Galdre (Sorcerers) & Haegtes (Fury-witches) can still choose to appear unthreatening until they reveal their true forms, while the inhumanity of Hrēoplings & Wulvers is plain to see.

GALDRE  
These sorcerers could have been born human, but they have transcended both mortality & morality in their unending desire for power. Now in truth they are nothing but husks of humanity, their grotesque nature hidden by their magic.

**GALDRE SORCERER**
_Medium humanoid_
S+0, D+1, C+2, I+4, W+1, C+2
_AC_ 14 (magic armor)
_HP_ 71 (11d8+22)
_Spd_ 30ft
_Saves_ Int+7, Dex+4
_Skills_ Deceive+5, Insight+4, Intimidate+5, Legends+7, Perception+4
_Senses_ passive Perception14
_Languages_ Ancients, Trader's Tongue
_CR_ 5 (1800xp)
_**Traits**_
_Defeatable_: If begin Turn with under 30HP, gain Defeated condition.
_Magic Armor_: Sorcerer's AC equals 13+DEX.
_True Form_: If the sorcerer begins its turn with under 15HP, they drop their Glamor & can be seen for their True Form: a tall & spindly twisted thing of oily-dark shadow.
_**Actions**_
_Broken Gaze_ Spell+7 to hit, range 120ft, 1 target. Hit: 13(2d8+4) crush dmg.
_Twist & Torment_ (recharge 5-6) Spell+7 to hit, range 60ft, 1 target. Hit: 22(4d10) crush dmg.
_**Reactions**_
_Magic Shield_ when attacked, the sorcerer can use their magic to increase their AC+5 until end of next turn.
_**Removing Undefeatable**_  
**Wound-proxy**: Sorcerers might use techniques like redirecting the damage they take to another person or object in which case the connection must be broken.  
**Severed-soul**: The sorcerer’s soul or heart is hidden in an external vessel & must be found & destroyed.
_**Note**: If the sorcerer’s revised challenge rating is 9 or higher, then its to hit modifier becomes +8 for all attacks (+10 with Keen Intellect) & raise all Saves & Skills by +1._

_**Description**_
**Glamour**: Whenever sorcerers choose to interact with common people (or even leaders, most of the time), they use their magic to hide their inhuman form & often appear as an older person, wise & venerable.
**Tactics**: Sorcerers are clever folk & often choose to interact with Heroes & others in social situations first, in order to judge their threat. If attacked directly, they will use all of their magic available to them to defend themselves, however. A Monstrous sorcerer will often brag about their immortality & be more prone to purposefully showing its true form.
**As a Monster**: The sorcerer’s goals & methods may be more esoteric than other Monsters & it may have direct plans for the Hero & their Followers. Its lair is likely wondrous or eerie in some way & they may have traps or otherworldly servants guarding it.

_**Burdens**_  
**Awkward**: Reduce the sorcerer’s CHA to 13 (+1), Deception & Intimidation to +3.
**Unstable**: The sorcerer has been consumed by its powers & no longer thinks rationally. At the beginning of its turn, roll a d6. On a 1, the sorcerer spends its turn lecturing or berating its enemies, taking no actions. On a 2-3, it uses 1 of its magical features if it has any, otherwise it uses its Broken Gaze. On a 4-6 it takes a normal combat turn. This burden reduces the sorcerer’s challenge rating by 1, to a minimum of 5.

_**Gifts**_  
**Keen Intellect**: Increase INT to +3, INT Saves & Legends to +9, all Spell attacks to +7 & the DC for all magical effects increases to 17. Increase challenge rating by +1.
**Tough**: Increase CON +3 & HP to 82 (11d8 + 33).
**Undefeatable**: Remove the Defeatable feature. The sorcerer only takes 1 point of damage from any attack. Increase challenge rating by +2.
**Magical Feature**: Choose 1 of the following features to add to the sorcerer. You can take this gift more than once, raising the sorcerer’s challenge rating by 1 for every 3 magical effects. The sorcerer’s magical features use INT.  
- **The Moon’s Wheel**: The sorcerer chooses a spot within 60ft & uses their action to cause a sphere with a radius of 15ft to plunge into complete darkness. The sorcerer can still see the creatures within the area of effect. Other creatures in the area are blinded unless they have a way to see in darkness. Ordinary light sources cannot pierce the effect. The effect ends after 10 minutes or when the sorcerer uses another magical feature.
- **Burst Lappings**: As an action, the sorcerer selects a creature within 60ft & makes a ranged spell attack. On a hit, the target deals only half damage with weapon attacks that use STR for the next minute or until the sorcerer uses another magical feature.
- **Branch-sorrow**: With a bonus action, the sorcerer’s weapon becomes wreathed with magical flame. On its turn it can make a melee spell attack (+7, or +9 with Keen Intellect) to do 10 (3d6) fire damage. The weapon sheds bright light in a 10ft radius & dim light for another 10ft. The effect lasts for 10 minutes or the sorcerer uses another magical effect.
- **Iron-fire**: The sorcerer can use an action to make a metal object glow red-hot. A creature in physical contact with the object takes 9 (2d8) fire damage. On subsequent turns the sorcerer can use a bonus action to cause this damage again. If a creature takes damage from the object, it must make a CON:15 Save or drop the object if it can. If it cannot, it has -DisAdv on attack rolls & ability checks until the start of the sorcerer’s next turn. The effect lasts for 1 minute or until the sorcerer uses another magical effect.
- **Hand-Stay**: The sorcerer uses its action & chooses a person that it can see within range. The target must succeed on a WIS:15 Save or be paralyzed for 1 minute. At the end of each of its turns, the creature can make another WIS Save, ending the effect on a success.
- **Sight-Shield**: As an action, the sorcerer becomes invisible, along with everything it is wearing & carrying. The effect lasts 1 hour, or if the sorcerer attacks a creature or uses another magical effect, it ends.
- **Misty Step**: As a bonus action, the sorcerer surrounds themselves with silvery mist & teleports to an unoccupied spot it can see within 30ft.
- **Flame-Feeder**: The sorcerer uses its action & makes 3 ranged spell attacks, each at a target within 120ft (it can choose the same or a new target for each attack). On a hit the target takes 7 (2d6) fire damage.
- **Sky-Hammer**: As an action the sorcerer causes a painfully intense ringing noise to emit from an area within 60ft of it. Each creature within 10ft of the point must make a CON:15 Save, taking 3d8 thunder damage on a failed save or half as much on a successful one.
- **Gale Counsel**: The sorcerer uses an action & suggests a course of activity (limited to a sentence or two) & magically influences a creature it can see within range that can hear & understand the sorcerer. Creatures that can’t be charmed are immune to this effect. The suggestion must be worded to make the course of action sound reasonable. Asking the creature to stab itself, throw itself onto a spear, immolate itself, or do some other obviously harmful act ends the spell. The target must make a WIS:15 Save. On a failed save, it pursues the course of action the sorcerer described to the best of its ability. The suggested course of action can continue for the entire duration (8 hours). If the suggested activity can be completed in a shorter time, the spell ends when the subject finishes what it was asked to do. The sorcerer can also specify conditions that will trigger a special activity during the duration. If the sorcerer or any of its allies damage the target, the spell end.
- **Lie Killer**: As an action, the sorcerer creates a magical zone that guards against deception in a 15ft radius sphere centered on a point of its choice within 60ft. Until the spell ends, a creature that enters the spell’s area for the 1st time on a turn or starts its turn there must make a CHA:15 Save. On a failed save, a creature can’t speak a deliberate lie while in the radius. The sorcerer know whether each creature succeeds or fails on its Save. An affected creature is aware of the effect & can thus avoid answering questions to which it would normally respond with a lie. Such a creature can be evasive in its answers as long as it remains within the boundaries of the truth.
- **Rafter-Plough/Mouse-kin**: As an action the sorcerer causes a creature within 30ft to become larger or smaller; resist with a CON:15 Save. Everything the creature wears & carries changes size with it, & any dropped items immediately return to their normal size. These effects last for 1 minute or when the sorcerer uses another magical feature.
| Rafter-Plough | Mouse-kin |
| ------------- | --------- |
| **Rafter-Plough**: The target’s size doubles in all dimensions, & its weight is multiplied by x8. This growth increases its size by 1 category -- from Medium to Large, for example. If there isn’t enough room for the target to double its size, the creature attains the maximum possible size in the space available. Until the spell ends, the target also has +Adv on STR checks & STR Saves. The target’s weapons also grow to match its new size. While these weapons are enlarged, the target’s attacks with them deal 1d4 extra damage. | **Mouse-kin**: The target’s size is halved in all dimensions, & its weight is reduced to one‐eighth of normal. This reduction decreases its size by 1 category -- from Medium to Small, for example. Until the spell ends, the target also has -DisAdv on STR checks & STR Saves. The target’s weapons also shrink to match its new size. While these weapons are reduced, the target’s attacks with them deal 1d4 less damage (this can’t reduce the damage below 1).|
