# ICRPG

## Core System

#### Turns
We’re ready to begin. Your GM gathers you all at the table, introducing the basic premise of the game ahead. “We begin on the deck of a mighty ship...” You have your characters ready, some dice scattered about, and a squiggly map on some index cards. “One day while sailing the open ocean, the ship is attacked by a squad of spear-wielding fish men! They’re climbing all over the ship, intent on killing all aboard! Let’s get started.”
The GM looks over to you and says the words that have launched a thousand epic tales: “It’s your turn, what will you do?”
All tabletop role-playing games find common roots at this moment. When it’s your turn, you don’t simply choose a button to push. The scene, as it stands, becomes yours to change, yours to explore, and yours to embellish. This could be as simple as asking “How many fish-men are attacking us?” or as complex as “I will draw my saber, grab hold of a mast-rope, and kick loose the reel-crank, sending me flying into the fish men, steel blazing!”
No matter how you choose to use your TURN, the ‘game’ occurs when the GM helps you resolve your effect on the scene, and then passes the spotlight to the next player. In time, you’ll see how fast and simple, or complex and meticulous this process can be.
This section describes how ICRPG handles the turn-by-turn process of creating, changing, and resolving scenes in your unique story. Mind your feet, adventurer, once you begin down this wide-open road of collaborative storytelling, there’s no telling where you might end up.
- Always Turns?: Turns give a session structure and an energetic pace, but it it feels weird to play in turns, maybe during roleplay, just go freeform!
- Who Goes First?: When a new scene begins, everyone rolls d20: highest goes first, then clockwise. Pray the GM doesn't win!

###### When the Dice Start Rolling
Sometimes during play, things are feeling loose and narrative. Story is being told, silly accents are being used, or maybe you and your chums are arguing how best to dispatch a hill giant. The GM may be leaning back, eating chips and grinning with sinister patience, or still using turns to keep everyone sharing the spotlight. When this happens, dice don’t have much to contribute.
Then, all hell breaks loose. Fish men attack your boat. The hill giant comes crashing into town. Cosmic rays bombard the space station. Time becomes terribly limited, danger is everywhere, and no mere words are getting you out of this alive. It’s time for action on your turn, and roll dice to see what happens.

###### Describe It
Most turns you make start with a description of something you’re trying to do, curious about, or want to affect in some way. If you’re stumped, just ask for details about what’s going on.
- "I'm going to attack the skeleton!"
- "I'll leap over the chasm!"
- "I'll force the airlock open!"

###### Roll the Bones
Once the GM hears what you’re imagining, he’ll let you know what kind of roll is needed, and let you know. Roll for it!
- "Roll d20+STR, beat 13."
- "Roll d20+DEX against 15."
- "There's a 50/50 chance. Roll d6 for me."

###### Get Results
Based on the outcome of your roll, you and the GM will both describe how things change, according to your success or failure.
- "Boom! You smash the skeleton!"
- "I made it! I go flying over the gap!"
- "Oh no, a 1? The airlock's jammed."

###### 3 Kinds of Turns
Unless you spend your TURN just talking, or looking good, it will take one of these three forms every single time. Not only will you get used to this formula, you will learn to master it, to exploit it, and to push it to the limit to survive. Better yet, to triumph. Here are the three types of TURNS in ICRPG.

**Action Only**: Sometimes, you're exactly where you want to be and staying put for this TURN. You might...
- Attack with a weapon
- Take a closer look at glyphs or symbols
- Call upon magic to cast a SPELL

**Move Near + Action**: Usually, you’ll need to move just a bit to get where you’re needed, then make a roll to do something. You might...
- Dash down a corridor and smash a hole in the wall
- Hurry to a friend and heal their injuries
- Move through a battlefield to block incoming arrows

**Move Far**: Use your entire TURN just to move twice as far as normal. If you just need to move as far as you can, you might...
- Sprint down a dusty street to escape an explosion
- Run to reach your grav bike before the bad guys steal it
- Dash and slide under a slowly-closing stone doorway

###### 3 Kinds of Actions
In two of the three TURN types, you’re rolling dice. That means you’re taking an ACTION on your TURN. ACTIONS are where most of the ICRPG system takes hold of the game, and makes itself known! There are three types of ACTIONS, differentiated by how much work they take to succeed.

**Simple Actions**: Some things are just cake. They take a moment of time, but no rolling is required. When doing a SIMPLE ACTION you might...
- Start up the engines on a starship
- Reel in the cable on a small cargo hoist
- Fix a saddle to your trusty steed

**Checks**: Instantaneous but uncertain ACTIONS require a single die roll. They either succeed or fail in a split second. When making a CHECK you might...
• Use your STR to shove a wooden crate aside
• Use lock-picks (and a little elbow grease) to jimmy a locked door

**Attempts**: Larger tasks can take time to complete. ATTEMPTS involve a D20 roll, and rolling EFFORT to complete a task or destroy a foe. You might...
• Destroy a security droid with multiple blaster shots
• Translate a tablet covered in mysterious old runes
• Cut your way through a barricade with your battle axe

#### The Target
Time for the nuts and bolts of making successful CHECKS and ATTEMPTS. In ICRPG, all the rolls in a scene are rolled against a single, all-powerful number: The TARGET. Whether it’s to hit an enemy, the difficulty of scouting in heavy fog, or the cryptic symbols of a dead language. In one scene, there is only one TARGET, and all rolls must meet or beat that number to succeed.
The TARGET is usually somewhere between 10 and 18. GMs can find out more about setting and modifying TARGETS.
No matter what roll you’re trying, you’ll need a few pieces of info. Usually, you’ll know these answers right away, based on what you’re trying to do, but your GM is always there to help.
1. **Is this a CHECK or an ATTEMPT?**: Sometimes it isn’t clear if what you’re trying will be instant or take repeated work. Either way, you’ll need the next two answers before you roll.
2. **What STAT am I using to HELP my ROLL?**: Characters have a set of STATS that describe their capability in different areas. Depending on what’s being tried, you’ll almost always get to add the value of 1 STAT to your D20.
3. **What is the TARGET?**: Every scene will have a number that’s always in view. That’s how difficult everything is in that scene. Roll your almighty D20, add your STAT, and meet or beat that TARGET to succeed! This simple process will be 90% of your rolls in ICRPG.

###### Target, Easy, & Hard
Most rolls you make will be against the TARGET as it is shown. If a 14 is in view, you’re rolling to meet or beat a 14 with a D20 plus one of your STATS. In the numerous possible situations of play, though, you will encounter rolls that are HARD and EASY. This a tool ICRPG uses to add detail to the game.

**When Things Are Easy**: If the TARGET is 15 or higher, you’ll be looking for ways to make things EASY. Here are just a few examples of how and why rolls can be EASY.
- If you are using tools or implements that assist you
- If you tried the exact same ACTION last TURN but failed
- If another character is assisting you
- If LOOT you are using makes certain ACTIONS always EASY

**When Things Are Hard**: Sometimes you want to do something really cool, or really unlikely. Your GM may announce, “Ok, but that’s a HARD roll.” Here are just a few reasons some ACTIONS will be deemed HARD to make.
- If you are pushing for extra results from your action, like double damage
- If what you’re trying to do is extraordinary or hard to believe possible
- If enemies or effects nearby are disrupting your focus or senses

###### Roll for Effort!
One of the core innovations in ICRPG is the concept of EFFORT. EFFORT simplifies and consolidates all kinds of variations in the outcome of your successful ATTEMPT rolls. Not only does it classify types of outcomes into easy, clear dice categories, it lends new detail to tasks that aren’t just doing damage.
Once you have made a successful ATTEMPT, it’s time to roll for EFFORT!

**Basic**: If you are only using your bare hands or your wits or improvised gear, roll a D4 a􀀮er a successful ATTEMPT to do damage with a punch, bend bars with raw muscle, or take time to decipher a block of coded writing.
**Weapons & Tools**: Any time you are using a standard melee weapon to do damage, roll a D6. Also roll a D6 when using proper tools to accomplish a task such as using a pry bar to open a jammed door, using bandages to cure a wound, or using a micro torch to seal a bulkhead hatch.
**Slings & Bullets**: Bows, slings, and guns are all deadly. Any time you're using a ranged weapon to attack, roll a D8. Ranged weapons come in many forms, with special ways to deal devastating damage.
**Magic & Energy**: Roll a D10 for EFFORT when you are casting explosive magic or using arcane energy. Also roll a D10 for any weapon or effect that employs energy such as particle beams, lasers or plasma. Healing with magical power? That would also be a D10.
**Ultimate**: Ah, the almighty D12. When you roll a critical success on your ATTEMPT, a natural 20 on the D20 roll, you’ll roll the type of EFFORT above that fits, and add a D12 on top of that roll! You have excelled at your ATTEMPT with ULTIMATE results!

#### Hearts & Effort
As you just noticed reading about EFFORT dice, you will be rolling against all kinds of tasks with EFFORT, not just rolling damage! Anything that can’t be accomplished in an instant will need EFFORT to complete. Once you get your head around this, you’ll see how versatile the system really is, and how it encourages all kinds of play beyond just doing damage.
How much EFFORT do you need to complete a task or destroy an enemy? That is where HEARTS come in!
Just like the classic video games of yesteryear, ICRPG uses HEARTS to show how many HIT POINTS (HP) an enemy has, or how much EFFORT is needed to overcome a task. One HEART is equal to 10 points of EFFORT or damage needed. It’s an arbitrary symbol to make the numbers distinct and easy to look at.
Using a sword, attacking a monster with 2 HEARTS? Do 20 points of damage with the D6 WEAPON die to be victorious! Using a magical translation SPELL to decode 1 HEART of ancient runes? You’ll need to roll a total of 10 with your D10 MAGIC die... it could be done in one TURN!
The GM will have all kinds of detail to offer with how many HEARTS a task or enemy has to overcome. Your job is to make those ATTEMPTS and roll as much EFFORT as you can. For more about building your character to boost EFFORT rolls, see the PLAYER’S GUIDE section.

#### Movement & Distance
Countless hours, mechanics, and questions are spent in RPGs about who is how far from what. Can I reach that wall? Is the ogre too far away to attack? ICRPG solves all this unnecessary detail with a simpler treatment of distance. Whatever it may be, it’s either CLOSE, NEAR, FAR, or OUT OF RANGE.

###### Close
If you can reach it with your fingers, just standing there, it’s CLOSE. This is toe-to-toe range, sword-fighting distance, and no move is needed to use or interact with CLOSE things.

###### Near
A few hurried steps get you to NEAR things. Imagine NEAR as being a few seconds away, things within reach of long spears, the distance of a quick-draw, or how far you can move in a TURN and still have time for an ACTION. On the average tabletop, it’s about 6 inches or so, about the length of a banana. Keep it loose. The real focus is on time, not exact distance.

###### Far
Well beyond NEAR, FAR takes you several seconds to run. The distance of a basic bowshot, as far as throwing a baseball, or a very challenging pistol shot. If you want to move FAR on your TURN, it will take the entire TURN to do so. An explosion with a FAR radius would be a huge blast! Look out!

###### Out of Range
Beyond FAR, as you play out a scene, is a distance you can’t reach in one TURN of movement, and none of your effects can reach. OUT OF RANGE defines the area in which most of the current action is happening, or you might want to move OUT OF RANGE of enemy fire! Even your allies cannot help you if you are OUT OF RANGE, so be careful splitting the group!
During play, your GM will help describe and answer questions about whether something is CLOSE, NEAR or FAR. It isn’t about exact measurements, it’s about what is thematically within reach of your character! Keep it loose and keep things moving, rather than getting out the ruler.

#### Time
As you read onward, thinking about cool ideas for characters, monsters, encounters or even full adventures, you’ll see time referred to in a few precise ways. As always, ICRPG keeps it simple.

###### Turn
When a player takes the stage for a few brief moments, moving and doing a few rolls, that is 1 TURN. A TURN is 10-20 seconds of action.

#### Round
When every player at the table, including the GM, has taken a TURN, that is 1 ROUND. ROUNDS are o􀀮en used to measure lasting effects, countdowns, or other things that last more than a few seconds. A ROUND is something like a minute in the game world, even if it takes longer to play.

#### Freeform
When something takes several minutes, hours, or even days to play out, there is less and less reason to sweat the details, or firmly enforce playing in TURNS. It’s still smart to keep moving around your table, addressing each player’s decisions during this stretch of time, but you won’t be accurately measuring movement or damage output. Things get more descriptive, and your GM will be introducing more ways to use dice to keep the story moving.

#### Dying
As characters struggle to stop evil forces, explore lost ruins, or battle back tides of alien invaders, death is never far away. In fact, if death is not a constant fear, the game has no real guts to it, no realism in its own context. To make this aspect of the game work well, a decisive, sudden set of rules around death are needed. ICRPG has a few twists on the classic rules of other games.

###### Zero HP
As you take damage in the bone-crunching worlds of ICRPG, you’ll eventually find yourself at 0. At that instant, your character drops unconscious. All SPELLS or effects you were creating vanish, and you’re bleeding out fast. The clock is ticking on your life.

###### Roll for Dying!
On your NEXT TURN a􀀮er you drop to 0 HP, roll a 1D4. Pray you roll high, because in that many ROUNDS, without help or a MIRACLE, your character will die with a capital D.

#### He's Dead, Jim
If all your DYING ROUNDS pass, no one helps you, and you can’t roll a MIRACLE, you are dead. No more rolls, no back door tricks. You’re toast.

###### I'm Not Dead, Yet!
On each of your TURNS while you’re DYING, you get a very narrow chance to miraculously regain consciousness. Roll a D20. If it’s a natural 20, some miracle of anatomy has brought you back awake with 1 HP. It’s a MIRACLE!

###### Annihilated
If you take so much damage in 1 cataclysmic instant to reduce your character to -20 HP, you are BLOWN TO BITS. You’re just mist and memories. Closed casket, for sure.

#### Recovery
There are a few ways to recover HP and avoid becoming a skeleton, besides hoping to roll a MIRACLE a􀀮er you’ve been pummeled to pulp.

###### Recover
At any time during play, sacrifice your TURN to pause, regain your breath, bind a few cuts, and RECOVER your gusto. To do so, roll D20+CON, and meet or beat the current TARGET. If you can do so, regain your CON+1 in HP instantly. Now get back in the fight!

###### Don't You Die On Me!
If you are unconscious and bleeding out, counting down precious DYING ROUNDS, you need help. If an ally can reach you and make a successful roll with INT or WIS on the current TARGET, your DYING timer stops in its tracks. You’re stable but unconscious, and owe that ally a LIFE DEBT.

###### Healing & First Aid
Be it through magical means (D10) or medical tools (D6), you or allies can heal you during battle. There are many ways to heal and be healed, as you’ll discover the more you play.

#### Inspiration
We haven’t talked about it much yet, but a great session of tabletop play owes itself to exciting, sincere, inventive role-play by players. This elusive element of the hobby is the topic of much discussion. Is it talking in character? Sacrificing self for others? Is it taking the game in new directions? Is it making the table more fun for everyone? 
Is it when you roll a sweet NAT20?
It’s all these things.
When the GM sees this kind of excitement in play, INSPIRATION is the way that moment is celebrated. “That was brilliant, take an INSPIRATION!”
But INSPIRATION doesn't function like you might think. You can't keep it, you have to award it to someone else; someone you inspired.
If you end a session or break fast with unspent Inspiration, it immediately goes away, healing you of that many random conditions or Stress.

###### Using Inspiration
Here are the rules for the coveted INSPIRATION, once granted by the GM. Spend INSPIRATION to...
- Re-roll _any_ die roll
- Add a D12 onto _any_ die roll
- Give your INSPIRATION to another character any time during play



## Making Characters

#### Step 1: Who Are You?
Before we get into the mechanical aspects of building a character comes the most important step: the CONCEPT. The best way to formulate a CONCEPT is to find a visual anchor for your character. Draw your own portrait, or find artwork that inspires you! Let yourself get into it. Devise a cool NAME. Keep your mind on that visual anchor, and start filling out all the bits on your sheet to fit.

###### Life Form
Are you an elf? A mech? A silicate shapeshi􀀮er? An undead revenant? Each WORLD in ICRPG has a set of LIFE FORMS to choose from. Reach back to your CONCEPT rather than nitpicking the STAT bonus.

###### Type
As you lean further into the WORLD your character will live in, and start to feel it, you can see your place in that world as a hero. Nothing will affect your STATS and role in your group more than your TYPE, so choose with care. TYPES are listed with the WORLD they are from.

###### Story
Before you start figuring out how the STATS add up, take a moment to explain 1 key fact about your character. This isn’t a backstory, or a past. This is what's going on right now. What's changed in your life that's pushed you from the humdrum to a life of adventure? How does it involve the other characters? If you’re drawing a blank, look deeper into the WORLD you’re playing in, and chat with your GM.

#### Step 2: Core Stats
Almost every time you’re rolling a D20 to do something in play, you’ll be adding 1 of 6 STATS to the result. These classic 6 STATS describe your specialties, your prowess, and help define your role in a group. The idea is to stack whatever STAT fits your heroic CONCEPT best, using STAT POINTS, a bonus from your LIFE FORM, and all the bonuses from LOOT you will eventually acquire.
For every character you create in ICRPG, start by assigning 6 STAT POINTS, in any array, to these 6 core STATS. Enter the points assigned in the ‘BASE’ line next to each die box. You could put 1 point in each, creating a generalist, or place all 6 in one STAT for the ultimate specialized hero. It’s your call. Now is the moment to remember your CONCEPT and emphasize STATS that fit!

###### Assign 6 Points, In Any Array, To Stats
No matter how awesome your character might be, no STAT can ever exceed STAT=10.
- **STR**: Put points into Strength to create a melee fighter, a crusher, a bar-bending, boulder-throwing behemoth who smashes his way through problems.
- **DEX**: Dexterity is a measure of how nimble you are, so you’ll roll with that STAT when you are trying to move silently, do back flips, or deftly run along crumbling rooftops.
- **CON**: Constitution measures how stout or tough you are. This STAT is used when recovering HP, bracing for impact, or fighting to survive poison or terrible cold.
- **INT**: Some heroes use brains over brawn. Their key STAT is Intelligence, which is used to cast SPELLS, investigate mysteries, recall details, or operate complex machinery.
- **WIS**: You’ll be using Wisdom to make ranged attacks, like guns and bows. This STAT measures an intuitive, organic kind of smarts. It isn’t so much knowing as feeling. How keen is your sixth sense? Place points here to be a scout, to be in tune with nature, or to feel danger coming.
- **CHA**: Your strength of will is measured by Charisma. You’ll be using this to roll for persuasive actions, resist fear, or drive enemies back with fury.

#### Step 3: Boost Effort Types
In the CORE SYSTEM section, you learned about the central concept of rolling for EFFORT. Here’s your chance to add bonuses onto those rolls during character creation, giving your character affinity for weapons, magic, or the risky business of ULTIMATE. You’re allotted 4 total POINTS to spend here.

#### Step 4: Locate Status Info
Below your character portrait artwork, and at the sheet bottom, you’ll find spots to track STATUS. Take a second to get familiar, as you’ll be making a mess here during play.

###### Defense
Add together all DEFENSE gained from LOOT you have, such as armor. That’s your total DEFENSE. A helmet may be DEF+2, this makes your DEF=2. When the GM unleashes effects or monster abilities, she’ll call ‘roll DEFENSE!’ Roll D20+DEF, and ***Meet Or Beat*** the current TARGET to resist the danger! 
When enemies roll ATTEMPTS against you, they don’t roll on the TARGET, they roll to meet or beat your DEF+STAT! No character, by any means, can exceed DEF=10, no matter the total DEF gained from any source.

###### Inventory
Capacity equals the sum of your Stats+4. This is further divided into 10 EQUIPPED items, the rest are just CARRIED. CARRIED items must be EQUIPPED to offer benefit or be used.

###### Hearts & HP
All characters start with 1 HEART, or 10HP. Circle additional HEARTS as your character grows. You can acquire HEARTS several ways as you play.

###### Inspiration
A big, hard-to-miss spot to record your INSPIRATION.

###### Dying
Don't die. Read up on the DYING rules. Track it here.

###### Mastery
They say the best way to learn is to fail. The highest form of progression for a character is called MASTERY. Each time you roll a NAT1 on a D20, mark 1 point of mastery on your sheet. When you have 10 mastery points, you’ve made it! You have now mastered an element of your character!
Here’s the best part: once you’ve reached MASTERY, clear out all your MASTERY points and choose any MASTERY ABILITY for your TYPE! If that ABILITY calls for a specific STARTING LOOT, gain it instantly! Yes, MASTERY is huge.
This process can be done again, but now you have to reach 20 MASTERY points. Every time you clear out your MASTERY points, the total required for next time goes up +10.

#### Step 5: Record Abilities
ABILITY describes an intrinsic character feature; it can't ever be lost or removed. You’ll gain a few ABILITIES when the character is created, and when you reach a MILESTONE. It’s important to peruse character ABILITIES, because they greatly impact your specialization, areas to outshine others, and value to a group. Some ABILITIES interact with others in powerful ways... when this happens it's called ‘synergy,’ and it’s cool.
- **Choose 1 Ability From Your Type**

#### Step 5: Choose Powers
There are heroes, and there are super heroes. If you are creating a character in VIGILANTE CITY, or a character with superhuman capability in any WORLD, you’ll be selecting and using POWERS. POWERS are like ABILITIES, they can never be taken away once gained, but they are nearly unlimited in potential. POWERS, unlike ABILITIES, will never be added to your character. They can only upgrade over time.
- **Creating a Superhero Character; choose any 3 Powers**

#### Step 6: Record Augments
Some stories alter the heroes themselves. When technology -- digital or arcane -- is integrated into living bodies, those are AUGMENTS. These are mainly found as cyber implants in cyberpunk games, but every genre has the potential for mechanical limbs or eerie crystal eyes.

#### Step 7: Loot Up!
Here is where ICRPG really finds its identity, besides the ever-useful index cards themselves: LOOT! The majority of your character’s progression and power will be in what LOOT you have and use. LOOT can be found, awarded, created, traded, lost, and destroyed. Even SPELLS are kept on scrolls or in books. Gems, chains, and counterweights enhance weapons. From the magical to the digital, what you CARRY versus what you keep EQUIPPED will let you tune and adjust your character for all kinds of special capability. Complete your new character by choosing 4 BASIC LOOT, then follow the two key rules below as you grow and gather more goodies.
- **Take 1 starting LOOT from your TYPE
- **Take any 4 BASIC LOOT from your WORLD
- **Always feel free to choose ABILITIES or LOOT for your TYPE either as STARTING or MILESTONE rewards! More possibilities are always good!**

## Player's Guide

#### Things You Knows
These facts are known across all the realms, and should in some way affect the origin story of every character you create. Troubled times...

###### Delicate Beginnings
_A beginning is very delicate time. Know then, it is the year 10191. The known world is a mere century free of the Imperial tyranny of the Elfking & God-Emperer Asuryan, my father. In this time, the most precious & dangerous substance in the universe is magic. Magic extends life, extends consciousness, & is the stuff of Dreams. A product of magic, the red dust vermeil, stains violet the lips of Sapphire Ministry Obligators but affords them untold powers, as true magic is proscribed & taboo. The red dust is vital to their status & legitimacy; the Church of the Unconquered Sun & it's Obligators monopolize faith & divine authority across the known world; only the Jade Hell barbarians oppose their mandate of forced-conversion. ---Lich-Queen Freya-Erandis-Vol, Princess of the Great-House Vol-Aeldari, Zorya-Nochnitsa, The Dragon Reborn, Last of the Elves & the True Dragons, Raven-Queen of Nix & the Shadowfell, Queen of the Damned, Bishop of Owls, Protector of the Emerald Claw, Lady of Illmorrow Spire; God-killer, Kin-slayer, Throne-breaker, Far-Seer, Black Sorceress of Nyx, the Nightstar, the Lion of Night, the Exile-Queen, & Mother of Ravens_

###### Dead Gods & Broken Moons
Aglabendis, the 'Tree that Held the Moon' & Seat of the White Tyrant the Elf King is destroyed; it took the Moon with it. All that remains is the Ring, detritus and debris of both moon and tree in a faintly sparkling band that girdles the world. Whatever happened to their Great Star Empire is unknown, only the Risen -- reviled confused undead -- remain.

###### Self-Determination
Once a scapegoat for every form of petty villainy, Humans have risen from their old ways as soldiers and servants of the Great Star Empire and embraced a new nobility. But they are a divided people, some choosing the hard but free life of the wilderness, others choosing an easier urban life under the harsh rule of the Dragonborn of Zir.

###### Holding Their Breath
Dragons are presumed dead after their apocalyptic battle with the elves; their servants the Dragonborn continue to grapple with this loss. Zir is their last standing city. In Ancient & Resplendent Crystal Zir _all_ are welcome, for a price. Service grants citizenship in the land of the Dragons. Many refugees flock here in the hope of a better life, only to settle into a lifetime of near-inescapable servitude.

###### By Thread or By Noose
Once the pinnacle of civilization, the Republic of Darokin has all but fallen to invasion from the horrors of the Nightmare Below. Remaining fortress-cities are under almost constant siege from nightmare horrors. The Wormroads are unsafe to travel unless backed by a battalion of veteran soldiers and leviathans. While the nobles refuse to sully themselves by surfacing and persecute an unwinnable war, the utilitarian merchant caste embeds its hooks into Zir via predatory loans and provocateurs.

###### Broken Worlds
_Every culture remembers the Dragon Break in some fashion; to most it is a spiritual anguish that they cannot account for. Several texts survive this timeless period, all (unsurprisingly) conflicting with each other regarding events, people, and regions: wars are mentioned in some that never happen in another, the sun changes color depending on the witness, and the gods either walk among the mortals or they don’t. Even the Shaperate-approved '108 cycles' is an unreliable measure._   With the dragons gone, time and space have become unanchored. Dragon Breaks are a phenomenon where linear time is broken, and people experience non-linear time-space. A Dragon Break not only precedes significant events, but challenges mortal comprehension. It is a re-alignment of time and space in response to an event which makes the normal continuity of reality impossible. The area affected, and length of the interval varies with each Break. Historically, the cause is attributed to mortals manipulating divine matters.

###### Darkspawn/Blight
Blighted creatures corrupted by the Nightmare Below. The Blight spreads out infecting everything it clutches, turning minds from sanity to madness & fear. Neighbor brutally murders neighbor, they mortify their own flesh, & commit horrifying acts of brutality on each other.
- humans turn to orks
- dwarfs turn to duergar
- dragonborn turn to ...
- kenku turn to dolgaunts

###### Burning of Suntree
With the rise of the Phoenix, and the ascendance of the Unconquered Sun, the Suntree was burned by zealots which starting the Great Conflagration.

###### The Risen
Unless properly cremated, dead humans become mindless undead within a few days; some of these soul-less husks eventually develop consciousness, becoming Hallowed. Fate casts them aside, finished with them.

###### Kinship of Iron
Once an obscure people in the dry volcanic steppes, Frost Giant patrols now dominate the northern wastes, laying claim to the entire region. It isn't known what prompted this recent militarization, but even mere patrols rival any army that would oppose them. They assert kinship with all ancient technology, and jealously covet all intelligent items. Woe be to any caught by their infamous vivisectionists.

###### All That Glitters
All metals are scarce having been mined out thousands of years ago. Crafters have learned to make everything through alchemical treatment and lamination of _chlén_-hide which sheds off the protective plates of the great _chlén_-beasts.

###### Awakened Dreamers
The veil between the Material universe and the Immaterial is thin, allowing the power of the mind to manipulate the world by strength of will alone. But escaping the Dreamlands is perilous and requires intense training and discipline lest you be trapped inside your own mind. Magical training is mostly controlled by the temples; those who refuse this paradigm are hunted apostates.

###### Open Road
Proper beasts of burden are basically unknown, the chlen-beast is too ponderous to make an effective cart animal, let alone a cavalry unit. Most goods are transported by water or heavy wheelbarrows. Carried litters are common among the rich, and rickshaws are available for rent in large cities.

###### Far-Gods
Contact with powerful interdimensional beings over millennia has developed into cultish worship and zealotry. These entities seem unable to manipulate or even directly perceive the Material realm, but their less-powerful Cohorts and Avatars seem able to directly manipulate the mortal world.

###### Climate
The average daily temperature is 30C-50C; night lows can plunge to -10C with spontaneous snow.
Due to the climate, armor is generally only worn on the battlefield or in high risk situations. Everyone wearing armor in the daytime must make a CON check per hour or suffer exhaustion.
Scale and mail are common: made of chlen-hide scraps.
Note that armor assumes a helmet. Going without worsens AC by 1 and could mean a lucky hit to the head for more damage and possible stunning.

###### Narco-State
Without access to the proper yeast to ferment or distill alcohol, the people of Zenith turn instead to different mind-altering substances. Tea is synonymous with drinking water; every street corner and village has a cafe; many whom double as travel lodges, public baths, & penny universities. The common social drugs are typically consumed in clanhouses specialized as private clubs, or the public parlors of alchemy-focused clans.

###### Aliens Everywhere
Even though nothing on Zenith is "normal", biomes & lifeforms are analogous. While there are no wolves, there's dogs. No bears or elephants, but dinosaurs all over the place. The Jade Hell's primary 'trees' are giant empress mushrooms.
