###### The Suns
The 2 suns of the world orbit around the equator of the Forge. The larger Crux is roughly comparable to Sol, and is about the same distance away. The red sun Storm is considerably smaller. Despite this they appear roughly the same size from the surface due to the distances involved.
An item of curiosity to most sages is that both suns rotate about the Forge. There is still much argument on this point, but the best theory is that there is a single immovable point in the center of the world. The planet itself revolves around this point, but never moves from its position in space, compelling the heavier masses to orbit the Forge. It is unknown why the Forge appears fixed in space; most sages believe the Forge is held in place by some ancient and powerful magic, and few seem interested in arguing against this theory without some kind of proof.
The yellow sun has a perfectly flat and circular orbit, bathing the Forge in the same amount of heat and light each day. The constancy of Crux and the lack of tilt in its rotation is what causes the polar regions to be considerably colder than those near the equator.
The red sun, in contrast, is quite close to the planet and is almost closer to an incendiary moon than a true sun. However, it does give off considerable heat and light, and when viewed from the Forge, appears quite similar in size to the yellow sun. Storm's orbit is slightly elliptical and tilted, creating the planet's seasons.
A day is marked by the setting of the yellow sun, marking a complete rotation on its axis. The red sun orbits on a monthly cycle (28days), while the yellow sun takes a full year (364days).

###### Stars of the Hours
These 8 stars are spaced evenly around the night sky at the equator. A star calendar and knowledge of the current date are required to read the stars, which may be used to discern the time of day. On the first day of each year the rising of these stars corresponds precisely to the 8 named hours of the day: Shroud, Slumber, Stir, Toil, Spark, Repast, Haven, and Regale. As the year progresses, the rising of each star are offset by a number of hours specified by looking up the date in the calendar. Each one of the stars of the hours is identified by its own color.
Days begin at the hour of Shroud. People typically awaken at the hour of Stir, and begins work by the hour of Toil. Work lasts until Spark -- also called Repast, the lunch hour -- after which labor continues for another few hours until the hour of Haven when the workday ends and dinner begins. Finally as the hour of Regale approaches people begin preparing for bed.

###### The Northern Star
This brightness in the night sky is not a true star, but the reflected light of the Chaos Gate. It's identifiable by nearly everyone on the northern hemisphere, and can be relied on to discern true north. It affects the aurora in strange ways.

###### Telling Time & North
The hourly stars are difficult to discern, but still possible. A successful DC20 Nature check informs the current time of day or the direction of true north during times of relative darkness. Local conditions such as excessive light, cloud cover, or a storm increases the DC+5.

###### Day & Night
Light conditions vary greatly throughout the month.
The 1st week in the month begins when both suns are aligned in the sky. The very 1st day is marked by 12 hours of intense bright light from both suns and a harsh white sky. As the week progresses, the red sun begins to rise earlier each day, extending the daylight period and marking it milder, while the night period gradually shrinks away.
The 2nd week begins with 6 hours of darkness, after which the red sun rises, giving the world a bloody sky. At midday, the yellow sun rises, making the day hot & bright, with a blinding white sky. After the 18th hour, the red sun sets, leaving the yellow sun high in a beautiful blue sky. At the end of the day, the yellow sun sets, leaving the world dark again for a few hours.
From this point, the night period continues to shorten until at the 3rd week, the sky is bathed in red sunlight for the first 12 hours & then yellow for the next 12. Over the next few days, a new night period forms after the red sun sets & before the rising of the yellow run. The night continues to grow into the 4th week, when the suns begin to align again. The night lengthens and the day continues to get hotter over the next few days, until at the end of the 4th week, the 2 suns again align and the cycle begins again.
Both suns give off what is considered to be full sunlight, and the red and white sections in the chart below should be treated the same as the yellow. For narrative purposes, light from the yellow sun is akin to Earth's daylight, but light from the red sun imparts everything with a ruddy quality, as if viewing the world during sunset. When both suns are present, the red quality is not noticeable, but everything is brighter, sharper, and more distinct.

###### Seasons
Blooming (Spring): Warm in all regions. Flora at its finest, with most of the blossoming plants showing their flowers, and the greens nearly all in season.
Wasting (Fall): Plants wilt from the heat, the time of harvest.
Seething (Summer): A time with little darkness to interrupt the day, and in which the world suffers a constant barrage of sunlight. Flora all lose their leaves & edible parts except for those few evergreens.
Sleeping (Winter): Nearly all plants are dead or barren.

###### Counting Years
The most common calendar is the Chantry calendar, which measures time in 'Ages', each a century. In the 99th year of an Age, the Divine seeks signs or portents of things to come in order to determine the name of the coming new Age. Ages start at zero and end at 99.
1. Divine
2. Glory
3. Towers
4. Black
5. Exalted
6. Steel
7. Storm
8. Blessed
9. Sun

###### Gifts
Each outsider that enters the Forge receives an extraordinary power, referred to as an arrival gift. They're mutations basically. Humans get Magic Adept at 1st level.

MAG
Magic stat can be used to resist magic at player's discretion. Since sorcerers use it as their magical power, they can't use it this way; they use their level.
