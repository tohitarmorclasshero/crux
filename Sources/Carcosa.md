Unnatural Aging: The alien forces of the universe exact a price on sorcerers. 
Performing a sorcerous ritual (other than rituals of banishing) requires the sorcerer to 
save vs. spells or physically age one or more years. Roll on the following table to 
determine the exact number of years aged:

| d10 Roll | Years Aged |
|----------|------------|
| 1-9 | 1 |
| 10-14 | 2 |
| 15-17 | 3 |
| 18-19 | 4 |
| 20 | 5 |

Thirteen races of men exist on the planet of Carcosa:

Blue Men
Bone Men (transparent to bone)
Dolm Men
Jale Men
Ulfire Men

Carcosa has 2 additional primary colors: ulfire (infrared) and jale (ultraviolet). -- The sense impressions caused in an observer by these two additional primary colors can only be vaguely hinted at by analogy. Just as blue is delicate and mysterious, yellow clear and unsubtle, and red sanguine and passionate, so he felt ulfire to be wild and painful, and jale dreamlike, feverish, and voluptuous. (David Lindsay, A Voyage to Arcturus, chapter 6: ―Joiwind)

Dolm -- stands in the same relation to jale as green to red. A compound of ulfire and blue. (David Lindsay, A Voyage to Arcturus, chapter 18: ―Haunte)

Jale men are reputed to be the most adept at sorcery.

EXPLANATION OF SORCEROUS RITUALS

**Banish the Nighted Essence**: This two-minute ritual is effective only on clear days with the sun within two hours of noon. The sorcerer casts a white diamond (of at least 10,000 g.p. value) at the Lurker amidst the Obsidian Columns. On a successful to hit roll, both the diamond and the Lurker shatter into infinitesimal fragments. The Lurker then sullenly reassembles in its lair in the Obsidian Ruins.

**Banishment of the Lightless Chasm**: This fifteen-minute ritual requires the sorcerer to slay a venomous snake with a sickle made of hammered metal taken from any of the Idols of the Eight Hundred Gods (in a subterrene adytum in hex 2501). The Squamous Worm will be violently pulled by invisible forces into the narrow Lightless Chasm far below the earth.

**Blasphemous Glyphs of the Night Ocean**: This ritual takes only five minutes to complete. The sorcerer must travel to the subterranean Night Ocean in hex 0507, there to study the nightmarish glyphs carven upon the dark, wave-lapped pillars of basalt. After 2-5 hours of intense study, the sorcerer will either comprehend the formula for banishing the Fetor of the Depths back to its lair, or the sorcerer (if a save vs. spells is failed) will become a raving lunatic, doomed to lurk and starve in the Night Ocean.

**Cast into the Icy Vacuum**: This ritual takes 10 minutes to complete. At the end of the chant, the sorcerer must throw at least a quart of lava on the God of the Primal Void, which will banish it to outer space. Note that finding a container that can hold lava without melting will be no easy task. Perhaps something could be found amongst the high technology of the Space Aliens, or in the inhuman technology of either the Great Race or of the Primordial Ones.

**Chambered Vaults of Wandering**: To complete this 5-minute ritual, the sorcerer needs a pound of the ever-malleable gray clay found only in the area surrounding the Bottomless Lochs. From this he fashions a crude humanoid that grows to the size of the Shambler of the Endless Night, which then pummels the Shambler for several minutes until the Shambler melts into swamp muck, thus returning to wander the extradimensional vaults until summoned again.

**Descent of the Six Thousand Steps**: The sorcerer must obtain one of the 33 Sunstones crafted eons ago by the Snake-Men. He boldly thrusts it towards the Slime God and shouts the four-minute formula. This sends the Slime God fleeing down through the pores in the ground to mysterious regions far below the earth.

**Dispel the Watery Death**: This ritual takes ten minutes to complete. It requires a copper brazier, any mammal for the sacrifice, and a handful of powdered lead from the Thaggasoth Peaks. The sorcerer must burn the sacrifice alive in the brazier, and then cast the powdered lead into the body of water that the Watery Death inhabits. The Watery Death will then vanish.

**Dispelling of the Primordial Flow**: This ritual takes two minutes to complete. The sorcerer must have a razor of pure iridium. (Note that since iridium’s brittleness makes it difficult to work, mankind does not have the technology to create an iridium razor. The sorcerer will have to acquire one made by the Snake-Men or by the Space Aliens.) At the ritual’s end, the Lurker of the Putrescent Pits will retreat back into those far subterranean pits.

**Encrusted Glyphs of the Deep**: In hex 0108 beneath 100’ of water is a sunken temple. Engraved upon an altar therein are large, blocky glyphs heavily encrusted. If cleaned and meditated upon for an hour, the sorcerer will learn the secret of banishing the Leprous Dweller Below. The ritual itself requires five minutes to perform as well as the sacrifice of any non-human mammal.

**Glyphs of the Ebon Lake**: This ritual takes 15 minutes to complete. The Inky Crawler is banished to untold depths beneath the earth when, at the conclusion of the chanting, the sorcerer smashes with an iron hammer a chunk of talc taken from the northernmost of the Damned Isles in hex 0308. The only way to learn this ritual is for the sorcerer to find the indecipherable glyphs chiseled from a lone pylon rising from the inky blackness of the Ebon Lake found deep underground in hex 0614. There the sorcerer must fast and meditate alone upon the glyphs for nine days, illumined only by the phosphorescent purplish fungus found elsewhere in the extensive subterranean caverns.

**Impediment of the Iridescent Fume**: This ritual of banishment can be performed in only two minutes. The sorcerer must have a mixture of crushed gemstones of a total value of at least 15,000 g.p. These must then be burned in one of the gemstone lamps (small lanterns that burn only gemstones) of the lost Snake-Men. The gemstone lamp, in conjunction with the ritual’s chant and gestures, will produce fumes intolerable to the Violet Mist, sending it howling back to its lair in the Phosphorescent Vault.

**Litany of the Lightless Sea**: This ritual takes but five minutes to perform. The sorcerer must have the powdered roots of the black poisonous root vegetables that grow in the hills in and by hex 0104. Upon the completion of the ritual, the sorcerer blows the dark powder from a tube. The powder will rush upon the Colorless Ooze, thus rendering it visible for several moments. While it is visible, the sorcerer can sternly command it to sink through the earth down to where it was spawned in the Lightless Sea.

**Measureless Chimes of the Uttermost Rim**: This 5-minute ritual requires eight musical chimes made of meteoric metal. The sorcerer must strike the weird notes (said to echo the unhuman melodies of ultragalactic space) upon the chimes to drive the Putrescent Stench off of the planet.

**Obstruction of the Suckered Abomination**: In an exposed outcropping of rock in hex 1103 is a layer of white crystal. A handful of it must be powdered fine for use in this 1-minute ritual which can succeed only when the sun is visible in the sky. The sorcerer must get close enough to the Suckered Abomination to throw the powdered crystal upon it, which will drive it back to its unknown lair.

**Stench of the Liquescent Amoeba**: This ritual takes but two minutes to complete. The sorcerer must have one of the nine small clouded glass bottles made by the Snake-Men for the banishing of It of the Fallen Pylons. Most of these bottles are hidden within buried ruins in the swampy, southern part of the Carcosa map included in this booklet. The ritual causes It of the Fallen Pylons to be assailed by the unendurable stench of the Liquescent Amoeba, which causes It of the Fallen Pylons to flee back into the outer voids.

CREATURES OF CARCOSA

**Diseased Guardians**: In appearance feral and filthy White Men, Diseased Guardians are typically summoned by sorcerers to guard treasures since (being ageless) they can guard a treasure literally forever. They attack with teeth and claws. In addition to causing 1 die of damage, a successful attack requires its victim to make a saving throw vs. poison. Failing the save indicates that the victim has been infected with a rotting disease that will prove fatal in 31 to 50 months. Failing three such saving throws in a 24-hour period will transform the victim into a Diseased Guardian, bound to the sorcerer who conjured the Diseased Guardians which transformed him.
- to conjure: Summon Diseased GGuardia
- to bind: The Many-Octacled Binding

**Mummies**: Mummies are sorcerous devotees of Nyarlathotep entombed beneath the ground in various places, most notably beneath the vast Radioactive Desert. Their appearance is similar to that of the unwrapped Boris Karloff in the 1932 film, The Mummy: slender humans with extremely wrinkled and dry skin. They typically dress in rotting hierophantic robes. The mummies of the world of Carcosa are not mindless, shambling things wrapped in bandages! Rather, they are dead sorcerers whose services to Nyarlathotep have earned them the state of being undead. They retain all their knowledge and abilities (including psionics) that they had when alive. Thus, mummies range from Summoners to high-level Sorcerers. Fire-based attacks cause +1 per die of damage against them, though all other physical attacks cause -1 per die of damage against them. Though most of their tombs are in the Radioactive Desert, mummies have traveled far across the planet.

**Mummy Brains**: As millennia pass, the dry bodies of mummies gradually crumble to dust. Usually the living brains of mummies rot away upon the dissolution of a mummy’s body. But a few of the brains of mummies who are of 8th or higher level and have an 18 intelligence score continue to think and exist. They appear simply as immobile but obviously alive human brains. Their long meditations and esoteric studies of the unimaginable nature of reality allow them to perform any sorcerous rituals they know, even without their bodies or any sacrifices or any of the material paraphernalia so typically required in sorcery. Mummy brains must only concentrate for the duration of time required for the ritual in order to perform it. Normal weapons (including Space Alien weaponry), poison, fire, and cold have no effect on mummy brains. These most feared of the undead are, fortunately, vanishingly rare.
- Psionics: 3-7 powers up to six times per day

**Unquiet Worms**: "The nethermost caverns are not for the fathoming of eyes that see; for their marvels are strange and terrific. Cursed the ground where dead thoughts live new and oddly bodied, and evil the mind that is held by no head. Wisely did Ibn Schacabao say, that happy is the tomb where no wizard hath lain, and happy the town at night whose wizards are all ashes. For it is of old rumour that the soul of the devil-bought hastes not from his charnel clay, but fats and instructs the very worm that gnaws; till out of corruption horrid life springs, and the dull scavengers of earth wax crafty to vex it and swell monstrous to plague it. Great holes secretly are digged where earth's pores ought to suffice, and things have learnt to walk that ought to crawl." (H. P. Lovecraft, ―The Festival, last paragraph) Sometimes the worms that feed on a dead sorcerer’s brain will assimilate the sorcerer’s memories and sorcerous and psionic powers. Such worms swell to thrice their normal size and assemble in a horrid, vaguely humanoid shape that walks as a man. Unquiet worms retain all of the dead sorcerer’s knowledge of sorcery, but they all fight as 4 HD monsters. These undead beings usually lair in tunnels that they dig surrounding the dead sorcerer’s tomb.

**Dinosaurs**: These animals are not uncommon in the world of Carcosa, though they are not of the sort one would find in a textbook on dinosaurs. Rather, imagine mundane dinosaurs mutated by mysterious forces for tens of millions of years. Dinosaurs on the planet of Carcosa tend to have one or more unusual characteristics such as: being feathered, brightly colored, misshapen, poisonous, phosphorescent, covered in spikes, able to breathe radiation, able to shoot energy from their eyes, etc. All dinosaurs, even the plant-eaters, tend to be aggressive.

**Beasts of Burden**: No horses or other mundane beasts of burden exist in the world of Carcosa. When humans want to travel, they typically walk or travel by water. This does not preclude any fantasic beasts of burden desired by the referee, such as giant lizard mounts, mutant pterosaurs, weird insectoids, etc.

SORCEROUS ITEMS

None of the magic items in the 1974 rulebook are present in the world of Carcosa. The following sections give an overview of the types of sorcerous items and high-tech 
items that can be found instead.

DESERT LOTUS
The desert lotus is found in many different colors, such as pallid blue, bone white, sickly green, nightmarish jale, and deep black. After undergoing a week-long alchemical process, they become powerful drugs when ingested or inhaled. Desert lotuses grow in shady areas of deserts, where they thrive in the light of the moon. They can also be found in some subterranean areas.

**Black Lotus Powder**: The deadliest poison known, it will instantly kill anyone who does not make a saving throw vs. poison at -6.

**Blue Lotus Powder**: This causes a deep sleep and a state of stasis, in which the slumberer physically ages merely an hour for every year slept. The only way to awaken one under the sleep of the blue lotus is to place a single particle of black lotus powder on his tongue (which would typically be fatal for anyone else). This will awaken the sleeper 90% of the time, and kill him 10% of the time. Sleepers awakened after a long time often have strange personality traits, as blue lotus sleepers dream. Years of dreaming, unpunctuated by any contact with reality, can unhinge even the most stolid of minds.

**Green Lotus Powder**: A victim of the green lotus powder falls into an unconscious trance for 9-12 hours, then awakens in a state of extreme weakness and sickness. He can do little other than speak sparingly, recline, and eat and drink. The green lotus sickness does not directly cause death, but the body becomes very thin and the mind prone to despair. Eventual suicide is common among victims of the green lotus.

**Jale Lotus Powder**: This induces beautiful though nightmarish hallucinations for 9-12 hours. Those who fail their saving throw vs. poison will afterwards be shrieking madmen (75% chance) or dead (25% chance).

**White Lotus Powder**: A person who fails his saving throw vs. poison will become a mindless zombie, enslaved to the will of the first one to peremptorily issue commands to him. Such unfortunates lose all sorcerous and psionic abilities. Regardless of former level, they forever after attack and make saving throws as 1st-level fighters, as well as being reduced to 1 hit die.

ALIEN TECHNOLOGY
This section covers only the tip of the iceberg of Space Alien technology. The Space Aliens possess a highly advanced technology (all the sorts of things found in 1950s science fiction and in Silver Age comic books particularly Kirby: robots, giant robots, flying saucers, rockets, intelligent computers, cyborgs, ray guns, powered suits, anti-gravity devices, teleporters, jet packs, orbital space stations, domed undersea cities, etc.). Because of the Space Aliens’ physical similarity to humans, Space Alien technology is much more comprehensible to mankind than is the lost technology of the Primordial Ones or of the Great Race.

Projectile Weapons
The Space Aliens construct thousands of types weapons based on elemental, electromagnetic, or any of a number of other principles. The following charts are provided for the referee’s convenience in determining specifics of such weapons:

Notes on the effects of special projections:

Bl. pudding, gr. slime, gr. ooze, or och. jelly weapons have a range of only one-tenth the norm. They do not cause any damage other than that caused by contact with the specific type of slime, ooze, etc.

Hardening foam weapons have a range of only one-fifth the norm. Those hit must save vs. paralyzation or be immobilized in the hardened foam.

Insanity weapons cause no damage. They instead wreak havoc with their target’s neuron configuration. Those struck must save vs. wands or fall into gibbering insanity 
for 1-6 hours.

Lightning bolts do an extra die of damage to those wearing metal armor.

Logic beams, rays, etc. do no damage. Any sorcerer struck by one during the performance of a sorcerous ritual will have the ritual ruined.

Paralyzation weapons do no damage. Those struck must save vs. paralyzation or be unable to move for 2-5 hours.

Polymorph weapons cause those who fail their saving throw vs. wands to be changed into whatever the weapon is designed to change targets into. Each weapon has a single setting. For example, one weapon might turn targets into stones, another weapon might turn targets into snails, etc.

Shrinking rays, pulses, etc. do no damage. Instead, they cause those struck to shrink to one-tenth size for 24 hours (save vs. wands to avoid).

Sonic weapons do base damage plus they will knock unconscious for 10-30 minutes any victim who fails his saving throw vs. wands.

Stun weapons do no damage. They knock unconscious for 1-3 hours those who fail their saving throw vs. wands. 

Teleportation weapons cause no damage. They teleport each individual affected 10-100 miles away in a random direction (save vs. wands to avoid).

Other Space Alien Items

Power Cells: Fully-charged power cells for pistols have 100 charges, rifle cells have 50 charges, bazooka cells have 25 charges, and cells for cannons and tank guns have 15 charges.

Telescopic Sight: Gives a weapon a +3 to hit in lighted conditions only.

Nightvision Sight: Gives a weapon a +3 to hit, even in lightless conditions.

Reflective Armor: Each suit of reflective armor prevents the wearer from taking any damage at all from 1-20 types of elemental weapons and 1-4 types of electromagnetic weapons. (If a given suit reflects lasers, it reflects 1-10 spectral colors.)

Battle Armor: These suits of attack armor come in an indefinite number of types. In addition to providing its wearer AC 2, a suit of battle armor will typically be equipped with 1-4 types of weapons (beam, ray, pulse, emitter, grenade launcher, and/or mini-missiles). In addition, each suit will be 20% to 50% likely to possess each of the following capabilities:
- Anti-grav flight (speed 24)
- Cloud giant strength
- Operational in a vacuum
- Operational underwater
- Force field of 20 to 50 hit points

Space Suit: A space suit makes its wearer immune to the effects of a vacuum, heat, and cold (though heat and cold weapons will affect the wearer).

Force Fields: Small devices typically worn on belts, they generate a nearly-invisible (save for a slight flickering) force field surrounding the wearer at a distance of 1’. Typical force fields take from 10-100 hp damage before being destroyed. If the force field is destroyed, the projection device will have to be repaired before it will function again.

Absorption Fields: As force fields, but they also have a special property regarding 2-12 select types of elemental and/or electromagnetic weapons. Strikes by such weapons actually replenish the field, on a one-to-one basis (i. e., if struck for 10 hp damage, the field gains 10 hp). The field can be strengthened up to twice its normal number of full hit points.

Communicators: Small, hand-held devices that enable two-way communication with anyone else within 10,000 miles who also has a communicator.

Healing Doses: These come in several sorts. Some cure 1-3 HD per dose, while others are antidotes to poison.

Night Vision Goggles: These allow the wearer to see in darkness.

Grenades: Grenades can be thrown 100’, and they have a blast radius of 30’. When they detonate they can release any type of weaponized electromagnetic radiation, element, or anything from Table 6: Special Projections. They can also release various types of smoke or gas (poison, choking, caustic, hallucinatory, obscuring, sleep, etc.).

Grenade Launchers: These have a range of 250’.

Bombs: With the same variety as grenades, bombs have a blast radius ranging from 50’ to 1,500’.

Mini-Missiles: These shoulder-launched weapons have as great a variety as do grenades. Range is up to 1 mile, and blast radius is 40’.

Missiles: These weapons are constructed in all the types as are grenades. Their range can be as little as 1 mile to as great as 12,000 miles. Blast radius varies from 300’ to 2,000’.

Some other technological systems that the referee might desire to give to robots:
- Self-destruct mechanism (explosion causing damage to all within range)
- Interchangeable parts (appendages, weaponry, etc.)
- Morphology that can be radically changed
- Linguistic module (can understand and translate any language)
- Teleportation
- Magnetic body and/or rays
- Vivisectionist appendages
- Etc.

Re-Programming Robots
Characters can attempt to re-program robots, one attempt per character per robot. Roll on the following table:
1-8: No effect.
9: Robot goes haywire, attacking every living thing.
10: Robot now a servant of its re-programmer.

Cybernetic Organisms (Cyborgs)
The Space Aliens are adept at modifying organisms with robotics, as well as at enhancing robots with biological material. While the majority of cyborgs are roughly 50% robotic and 50% biological, they vary widely (such as 95% robotic and 5% biological e.g., a robot with a biological brain, or 5% robotic and 95% biological e.g., an animal with a violet laser ray implant, etc.). A simple way to determine the characteristics of a specific cyborg is to randomly generate a spawn of Shub-Niggurath (pp. 37-41) and then roll some robotic characteristics for it on the Random Robot Generator, or (conversely) to randomly generate a robot and then roll some biological characteristics for it on the spawn of Shub-Niggurath tables.

TECHNOLOGICAL ARTIFACTS OF THE GREAT RACE
The remaining advanced technological items of the vanished civilization of the Great Race are so extraordinarily rare that many such items are unique. Unlike the high-tech of the Space Aliens which humans find relatively easy to grasp, the artifacts of the Great Race are nearly incomprehensibly inhuman. The lost technology of the Great Race is concerned primarily with space, time, and mind. A member of the Great Race can utilize one of their ancient artifacts about as easily as a human can use the high-tech of the Space Aliens. Humans, however, find it almost impossible to use these outré objects. Only humans with an intelligence of at least 17 can even possibly do so. After each month of continuous study, such a human has a 5% (non-cumulative) chance of understanding the item well enough to make some use of it. The artifacts given here represent only a small sampling.

Crystalline Psionics Chamber: This chaotic conglomeration of cloudy white, ulfire, and yellow natural crystals has a roughly cone-shaped chamber within (10’ high and 10’ diameter at the base). Any psionic creature that steps within the chamber will activate it, causing its body and especially its head to be pressed hard against the sharp crystals (1 die of damage). The crystals will glow with a soft, inner radiance and emit a low hum barely on the threshold of hearing. While in the chamber, the entity’s psionic ability will be greatly increased. He will be able to use all eight psionic powers, and he will be able to use these powers ten times more often than he normally would. Further, the range of each is increased ten-fold, mental blast causes 10 dice of damage, saving throws vs. mind control are at -5, and precognition can be used to see 10 minutes into the future. This is all so draining that when the user leaves the chamber he must save vs. wands or permanently lose all his psionic abilities.

Scrying Glass of the Old Ones: This is a jagged chunk of obsidian-like rock, roughly 18 square and 4 thick, weighing about 100 pounds. If one grasps it in his hands and gazes in its direction in utter darkness, the Scrying Glass of the Old Ones reveals its true nature. The stone becomes visible (only to the one touching it) as a deeper blackness than its surroundings, and dolm, ulfire, violet, and jale motes and swirls of light appear (with the impression of great depth) within the rock. If the holder of the rock does not look away, the lights within the rock will coalesce into visions of the domain of one of the Great Old Ones (such as R’lyeh, or Hastur’s crypt beneath Lake Hali, or the vast caverns in which raves Azathoth, etc.). The observer at this point must make a saving throw vs. spells or be unable to look away from the images in the rock. After 30-60 minutes time, the appropriate Great Old One itself will be glimpsed, and it will be aware of its observer. The Old One will bend its will towards the holder of the Scrying Glass, and if the holder fails his save vs. spells at -5 he will become an ardent devotee of that Old One. A successful save indicates that he has released the stone, thus ending the visions. Sometimes those fortunate enough to make their save come away from their viewings with fragments of knowledge of the arcane secrets of the glimpsed Old One and/or of its lair.

Spatial Transference Void: Over 100 million years ago a meteor from the deepest gulfs of space fell upon the planet of Carcosa. From its unique, uncanny metal the Great Race fashioned a shapeless blot upon space. In appearance the Spatial Transference Void is a roughly 15’ diameter blacker than black hole in existence itself, with indeterminate edges. Any man standing within 30’ of it will feel impelled to cast himself into it (save vs. spells at +4). Touching the artifact will cause 1 die of damage because of its intense cold. There is no known way to destroy the Spatial Transference Void since it does not exist as such (instead being a hole in existence). The Great Race used it to instantaneously travel to any precise point in all of infinite space. The most understanding that a human can gain of it is the knowledge of how to use it to travel to any particular cosmic body (planet, moon, star, asteroid, quasar, etc.). Such travelers must be careful that they do not appear in an environment fatal to human life (such as a planet with a surface temperature of 50 kelvins). The one operating the artifact must save vs. spells, or one or more of the space travelers will find himself in deep space rather than at his destination. Travelers through the Spatial Transference Void can return to the presence of the artifact by intensely concentrating for five minutes.

Temporal Transcendence Gulf: This bizarre conglomeration of forms, contours, and lineaments is over 10’ in diameter and weighs several tons. Its primary compositional materials are preserved brain matter from psionic spawn of Shub-Niggurath as well as an unknown magnetic ore. Simply being within 40’ of the artifact makes one feel lightheaded and displaced. Everything (including oneself) will seem relatively unreal and insubstanstial, while the Temporal Transcendence Gulf will seem to dominate its surroundings. This is because the artifact was constructed to exist in all times, whereas virtually everything else has only momentary existence in time. Because of this, the Temporal Transcendence Gulf is practically indestructible. Only by destroying it at each moment of its existence within time’s infinity can it be finally destroyed. Unsurprisingly, some degenerates worship it as a god. Its proper operation will enable those in the artifact’s presence to travel to any point in time, whether in the future or in the past. The best that a human’s fumbling efforts can do is to travel to approximate times, give or take a thousand years. Note that this time traveling is inherently dangerous. Perhaps the spot where the Temporal Transcendence Gulf is found was a pool of lava 400 million years ago, and the time travelers will suffer instant death by plunging therein. Further, each time a human operates the Temporal Transcendence Gulf, the operator must save vs. spells or one or more of the time travelers will find his existence scattered throughout many times. Such an unfortunate is forever lost.

TECHNOLGICAL ARTIFACTS OF THE PRIMORDIAL ONES
The remaining advanced technological items of the vanished civilization of the Primordial Ones are so extraordinarily rare that many such items are unique. Unlike the high-tech of the Space Aliens which humans find relatively easy to grasp, the artifacts of the Primordial Ones are nearly incomprehensibly inhuman. The lost technology of the Primordial Ones is concerned primarily with the biological sciences. Many of their artifacts seem to be living things, or a hybrid of living and nonliving substances, or perhaps even a third category other than life or non-life. A Primordial One can utilize one of their race’s ancient artifacts about as easily as a human can use the high-tech of the Space Aliens. Humans, however, find it almost impossible to use these outré objects. Only humans with an intelligence of at least 17 can even possibly do so. After each month of continuous study, such a human has a 5% (non-cumulative) chance of understanding the item well enough to make some use of it. The artifacts given here represent only a small sampling.

The Carven Rim: Over 82 million years ago a comet bearing microorganisms crashed into the planet, creating a crater nearly 2 miles in diameter. Strange fumes have ever since risen from the crater. The Primordial Ones fashioned the crater’s rim into an outré control center to manipulate the biological fumes perpetually shrouding the crater. Weird forms of gaseous life were thereby engineered by the Primordial Ones, but even these inhuman scientists had only sporadic success in controlling the things they created. A mere human foolish enough to dabble with the Carven Rim long enough to create a life form will be attacked by the alien and incomprehensible thing to which he gave rise. Anyone within 50’ of the gaseous entity has a 40% chance of himself dissolving into gas (no saving throw), a 20% chance of being poisoned (save at -1 to -4), a 20% chance of being stricken with 1-3 mutations, and a 20% chance of falling deathly ill. Any who become sick will remain incapacitated by sickness for a number of days (roll 1 die to determine exact number) and then must make a saving throw vs. poison. Success indicates recovery, failure indicates death.

Elder Signs: Very few of these small greenish stones have survived. Each is shaped like a thick coin, 4 in diameter and 1 thick, with a swastika-like symbol shallowly inscribed thereon. If strongly presented, they will drive off all Deep Ones (no saving throw). Elder Signs are almost impervious to being damaged, though persistent efforts to destroy them with advanced technological weaponry will succeed.

Fecund Protoplasmic Pit: This vile pit full of quivering and bubbling dolm ooze is 50’ in diameter. Entirely surrounding its 157’ circumference is a low panel of some unknown metallic stone covered with biomechanical knobs, buttons, levers, etc. Primordial One scientists used this pit to create many and varied forms of life. A human with some understanding of the Fecund Primordial Pit can once per day manipulate the controls to induce the artifact to produce a living thing:
1-44: immobile, organic goo
45-88: bl. pudding, gr. ooze, gr. slime, or och. jelly (equal chance of each)
89-94: a spawn of Shub-Niggurath that wanders away
95-97: a spawn of Shub-Niggurath that attacks
98-00: a spawn of Shub-Niggurath that will serve and obey its creator

Living Monolith: This abomination is a vast column (10’ thick, over 100’ high) of an amalgam of an untold number of types of organic material. All within 300’ of it feel disoriented and fearful. The monolith seems to not be perpendicular to the floor, but it is the monolith that seems to be straight up-and-down, while everything else (the very ground beneath one’s feet included) seems askew. All to hit rolls and saving throws are made at -2 within the Living Monolith’s range of influence. Ichor randomly streams down the monolith’s sides, and at times it seems to take breaths or to quiver, and it will occasionally scream (roll a die to determine how many turns between screams). When it screams a saving throw vs. wands must be made. Any who fail flee in fear. Those who penetrate the secret of the Living Monolith will be able to extract from its bulk flesh of any desired type. This flesh (when treated in the spawning pits of the Primordial Ones) can be grown into a fully-developed organism of the appropriate type. Such organisms will obey their creator. Further, the Living Monolith can be made to absorb the flesh of any organism within 300’ of it (save vs. dragon breath to avoid).

Mutation Inducer: This spiked and bulky contraption is vaguely rifle-shaped. It fires (with a range of 2,000’) a nearly invisible beam that causes its target to mutate (save vs. poison at -5). In the hands of a human this mutation will be random, but when operated by a Primordial One the mutation can be selected by the Primordial One. The Mutation Inducer has a limitless number of charges.

Primal White Jelly: This is a substance very like a jellyfish in consistency, but pure white in color and slightly translucent and phosphorescent. For each hour that it is within 5’ of a creature, it must save vs. poison or be inflicted with a random mutation. Those who discover the secret of the Primal White Jelly can grow from even a small piece of the jelly nearly any type of organism desired. This requires the facilities of one of the breeding pits of the Primordial Ones. Note that the generated organism will not be under the control of its creator.

Proto-Shoggoth: This is the semi-transparent ooze that was originally a part of the Primal White Jelly but was halted by the Primordial Ones very early in its development into a Shoggoth. The Proto-Shoggoth is mindless, quiescent until a strong will comes to dominate it. A human who discovers the secret of commanding the Proto-Shoggoth will have a servant that is able to follow simple orders, and which can shape itself into the rough semblance of any living substance -- animal, plant, fungus, etc. While the Proto-Shoggoth’s mimicry cannot fool anyone, it is accurate enough that there is never any doubt as to what it is mimicking. In any event, the Proto-Shoggoth will typically have the natural abilities (excluding psionics and sorcery) of whatever it is mimicking (unless it is mimicking a Great Old One).

MUTATIONS
Exposure to some of the weird radiations of the planet of Carcosa can cause physical organisms to mutate. When a living thing is thus exposed, it must save vs. poison. Failure indicates that it has mutated. The following table is intended as merely a starting point for an undoubtedly longer list of mutations that the referee will use in his 
campaign:

d% Roll | Mutation
01-04 1-4 limbs turn into tentacles
05-09 1-8 additional eyes open on random parts of the body
10-14 1-4 additional mouths open on random parts of the body
15-19 Fungoid growths all over body
20-24 All hair lost
25-28 Legs fused together into a worm-like lower body
29-32 Flexible snake-like jaws: Mouth can open wide enough to engulf a human head
33-36 Adverse to sunlight (-1 to hit and saving throws)
37-40 Amphibious, but can be out of water only 1-6 hours at a time, or lose 1 HD per 2 hours
41-44 Venomous bite/nails/skin (equal chance of each)
45-49 Eyes become unblinking and bulging
50-53 Eyes melt away (1 die damage and blindness)
54-58 Body becomes semi-gelatinous (third time with this mutation, become a puddle of slime)
59-63 Vile odor (chance of surprising reduced to 1)
64-67 Teeth become sharp like a carnivore’s (1 die damage with bite)
68-72 Cannibal/man-eater: Can digest only human flesh
73-77 Tongue turns into tentacle
78-82 Hair on head becomes a mass of waving cilia
83-86 Hemophilia: wounds that cause bleeding do double damage
87-91 Become a lumpy, misshapen, semi-humanoid (movement cut in half)
92-96 Skin transparent—charisma 3
97-00 Wounds take twice as long to heal
