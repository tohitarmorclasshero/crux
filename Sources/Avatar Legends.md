**Background**
Who was your character & where did they come from before getting caught up in the inciting incident? Your background explains your character’s origins & training, giving your character a backstory that goes beyond what you’ve already established through the inciting incident.
Choose up to 2 backgrounds to describe your character’s upbringing. Sometimes these backgrounds work together to describe 1 unified backstory -- Military & Privileged could describe a hero from a noble family -- but they might also describe 2 different periods of your character’s history, like a hero who studied at a monastery for years but left to join a band of outlaws when the monastery was destroyed. Your backgrounds affect social situations & tell us what kind of talents you might draw on when you trigger moves. The aforementioned outlaw monk might have a really hard time tricking a group of nobles into believing she’s 1 of them, but a hero who has been a noble his whole life might be able to not only convince them he belongs but know someone in the crowd! Of course, the tables would turn if the 2 heroes found themselves on the streets of Ba Sing Se...

**Military**
You trained to fight as a soldier in a military unit such as a mercenary company, a regional militia, or a state government’s standing army. Are you a soldier, sailor, or spy? Do you still answer to your commanding officer, or have you gone rogue?
*Examples*: Kyoshi Warriors, Iroh, Kuvira

**Monastic**
You are/were a monk, nun, or acolyte of a particular order. Perhaps you were devoted to finding enlightenment or helping others in a community with other like-minded devotees, or perhaps you were committed to scholastic rituals & bureaucratic traditions. What is your order’s goal? What are its rules? In what ways did your upbringing agree with you, & in what ways did you long for something different?
*Examples*: Aang, Fire Sage Shyu, Gyatso

**Outlaw**
You live outside the bounds of law & order as a criminal, insurrectionist, or pirate. Were you born into the lawless life, or did you come into it later on? Did you choose the outlaw life, or did the outlaw life choose you? Do you work alone or with a gang? Whom have you hurt just to stay alive?
*Examples*: Flying Opera Company, Jet & the Freedom Fighters, Tokuga

**Privileged**
You grew up in the lap of luxury, wealth, or prestige as a hereditary aristocrat, prominent merchant, or even the heir to a successful crime family. What advantages did your upbringing give you? Now that you’re no longer surrounded by safety & ease, what do you miss -- & what do you fear?
*Examples*: Asami, Zuko, the Beifong family

**Urban**
You grew up running the streets of a big city . You rub shoulders with people from many different walks of life, & you might not feel so at home if your journey takes you to the wilderness. What unexpected skills & knowledge do you have from city life? Which urban amenities do you miss -- & which hardships do you not miss? 
*Examples: King Bumi, Bolin, Jargala

**Wilderness**
You grew up in a town or household surrounded by nature, the elements in their most raw form, & developed advanced survival skills because of it. Which terrain makes you feel at home? What special skill are you most proud of -- perhaps orienteering, herbalism, sailing, or animal training? What excites you, & what scares you, about big-city adventures?
*Examples*: Avatar Korra, Lek, Katara

**Demeanors**
Every playbook has 6 demeanors, ways your character tends to behave in social situations or when they’re under pressure. Choose 1 or more from the options listed on your playbook, or make up your own if your vision of your character isn’t covered there. You might choose demeanors that tie into or contrast each other. When introducing your hero later on in this process, make sure everyone has a sense of how your character presents themselves & acts under pressure so they can develop a dynamic with them. Your demeanor doesn’t affect the game rules but is important because it affects how your character sees & interacts with the world (and how others see them). The specific options listed for each playbook are there for a reason -- they help guide you to the sorts of characters that playbook complements. An Icon might be Naive & Playful if they’ve been sheltered from the world & want to chase their interests over their responsibilities, or they might be Haughty & Grave if they believe their role should be respected by others & hold their burden important above all else.

**Fatigue**
Your character has a *fatigue track* with 5 boxes. When your character gets exhausted or injured, emotionally or physically, you mark fatigue by checking off 1 of those boxes. You don’t have to worry about these just yet! More information about marking & recovering fatigue can be found below.

**Conditions**
A condition is an emotional state that makes trouble for your character, making certain actions harder to perform successfully. Stressful situations require you to mark a condition to indicate how your character feels right now. You don’t start out with any conditions marked. More information about marking & clearing conditions can be found below.

**Balance**
Every PC has a balance track on their playbook which measures the push & pull of your character’s beliefs. You’ll find each of the 2 poles marked with a principle -- an idea about yourself or the world that matters to your hero. However, these 2 ideas are always in tension. Your character isn’t sure how to uphold 1 principle without denying the other, & their feelings about which has more importance change during the course of a game session. The balance track looks like this: 

|           | +3  | +2  | +1  | +0  | -1  | -2  | -3  |           |
| --------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --------- |
| Principle | C   | E   | N   |     | T   | E   | R   | Principle |
|           | -3  | -2  | -1  | +0  | +1  | +2  | +3  |           |

At the start of play, your balance & your center are both in the middle of the track -- you can shift your balance once in either direction right now, but you don’t have to. Your balance represents where your mind & spirit are right now & shifts regularly throughout the game. Your center represents your “default” position, where you return to when not under duress & pressure from others. Your center may actually change over the course of the game, but it happens rarely. Your balance always provides a pair of numbers, 1 for each of your principles. Those 2 numbers are your principle scores, or just your principles. Your 2 principle scores are always directly opposite each other, meaning that if your balance puts 1 principle at +2, then the other is at -2, & vice versa.
Your balance determines how your character feels about 1 of the central conflicts of their identity, but it’s also useful for calling upon as a strength when you live up to your principle. You can read more about balance moves on page 137!

**Moment of Balance**
Your playbook’s Moment of Balance doesn’t require any decisions to be made but it’s important that you familiarize yourself with it. Your Moment of Balance is a special & extremely powerful move that resolves an entire scene of conflict as described on your sheet. When you invoke it, you don’t roll -- instead, you take the spotlight & gain control of the scene, following the script of the text & describing how you accomplish something seemingly impossible in spite of overwhelming opposition.
Because your Moment of Balance is so powerful & marks a significant milestone in your hero’s story, your character must unlock their Moment of Balance through advancement (see page 210) before it can be used. Then, you must have your balance at your center in order to actually use the Moment of Balance. But once triggered, it removes uncertainty from the scene, & lets you grab the spotlight & do incredible things!
Your Moment of Balance is a big deal -- it’s your chance to save the day, no matter the odds! By reading the text of the move, you can learn a lot about the core underlying theme of your playbook. When you use it, the action should feel like the most memorable scene or episode in the “TV series” of your game.

**Center Shifts Off the Edge**
When you lose your balance -- your balance shifts off the edge of the track -- then your center shifts towards that principle as well. But what happens when your center shifts off the edge of the track? It takes some time, & it’s difficult to do, but it can happen.
Those moments indicate that the conflict within your character about their 2 principles is over. They’ve made their choice, in favor of the principle their center shifted toward.
If that happens during a campaign of play, during a “season,” then treat the PC as having only 1 principle -- that principle -- from that point forward. Their balance track stops at +0, & only goes up to +3 for that principle. They no longer have the other principle, & can’t be shifted toward it, tipped toward it, called upon to live up to it, etc.
Their center resets to +0. If they would shift their balance below +0, they instead mark a condition. They can still live up to the 1 principle they retain, & they can still lose their balance toward that principle & shift center as a result.
The GM & player work together to go through the feature of the playbook & pick out any elements that now are resolved & don’t make any sense for the PC moving forward. For any moves specific to the playbook that call upon a principle they no longer have, the character should generally lose access to those moves.
For any character who has resolved a principle like this, at the end of that campaign or season -- or even earlier! -- the PC must switch playbooks to something that matches their new issues, with a new set of principles.

**Center Shifts as Character Arcs**
Losing your balance & shifting your center is a hugely important part of your character’s immediate story, but it’s worth looking at your center as a kind of long-term measure of your character’s overall arc as well. Each time you shift your center toward 1 of your principles, your track grows a little shorter -- it’s easier to lose your balance toward that principle again in the future! As you tilt 1 direction, toward 1 principle, you can start to see where your character might end up.
If you like that direction for your character, it’s okay to lean into it & push toward 1 of those principles. In the end, you’ll change playbooks & find a new chapter of your character’s story or retire the character completely. But it’s also okay to use your balance shift advancements (page 210) to push your character away from the edge, giving yourself more time to play out the tension inherent in your playbook’s principles.

**Connections**
Don’t fill out this section yet -- connections tell you how your PC is connected to the other companions & you haven’t been introduced to those other PCs! Check back in on your connections while “Bringing the Cast Together” (see page 123). You’ll select which of the other PCs fills each connection when you’ve had a chance to meet those characters & introduce your own!

**Growth Question**
At the end of every game session, the players discuss what their companions learned during the course of the episode. There are three questions everyone always answers -- you can see those on page 142 -- but each playbook also has a question which only that character answers. Each “yes” answer allows you to check a growth box. When you mark the fourth growth box, you advance (page 210) & choose 1 of the options under growth advancement. You don’t have any decisions to make here but consider what triggers this so you can play towards it. The rate at which your character advances & grows is in your hands!

**Balance Moves**
In addition to the basic moves, every character can make any of the balance moves too. These moves affect your character’s balance track, their principles, & the balance of others. The five balance moves are live up to your principle, call someone out, deny a callout, resist shifting your balance, & lose your balance. Your character’s balance is their heart, what guides their story, & their long-term development all in1. This section explains how each of these crucial systems & moves work in detail. For more on the general systems of your principles and balance, see page 102.

**Live Up to Your Principle**
When you take action in accordance with the values of a principle, mark 1-fatigue to roll with that principle instead of whatever stat you would normally roll.
The Hammer wants to punch an antagonistic NPC that they blame for a bad situation, but realizes their target isn’t some evil mastermind...they’re scared & being manipulated by others. Rather than give in to their instincts, the Hammer offers a hand to the other person & declares that they understand what they’re going through & want to help, not hurt them -- the Hammer is guiding & comforting that NPC, but also living up to their principle of Care!
Any time you take action that aligns with 1 of your playbook’s 2 principles on your balance track, you can live up to your principle before you make your move. Rather than roll with the stat that move normally tells you to, you roll with the principle’s value on your balance track. This means as your balance track shifts hard to 1 side, you roll with an increasingly high bonus when living up to your principle in that direction. In this way, you can offset a low or negative stat by living up to your principle if that principle matches your action. However, this isn’t something you can do all the time -- pushing yourself to embody a principle in this way always costs 1-fatigue!
To trigger this move, your action needs to meet 2 conditions. First, it has to be an action that triggers a move with a stat roll (basic, playbook, even the stance move) -- if a move tells you to roll without any modifiers, you can’t live up to your principle, just like how you can’t if a move’s outcome doesn’t require you to roll dice. Second, it has to fit the values of 1 of your principles. When the Icon intimidates someone into backing down, it’s not enough for them to say they’re living up to their principle of Role -- they need to describe & show how they’re using their belief in their position & their status as the Icon in this moment, in order to use their Role instead of their Passion.
If you want to live up to your principle but you’re not sure how, talk to the GM or the group about how you can make your actions align with the principle you’re trying to live up to. The GM might tell you that you need to do a little more to truly live up to that principle, or that you might need to pursue another course of action to live up to the principle.

**Call Someone Out**
When you openly call on someone to live up to their principle, shift your balance away from center, then name & roll with their principle. On a hit, they are called to act as you say; they must either do it or mark a condition. On a 7–9, they challenge your view of the world in turn; mark 1-fatigue or they shift your balance as they choose. On a miss, they can demand you act in accordance with 1 of your principles instead; mark a condition or act as they request.
When you make this move, you remind someone (a PC or NPC) of 1 of their principles & call on them to take immediate action related to that ideal. You might be reminding them of their responsibilities, begging them to live up to their ideals, or calling them on how their actions are inconsistent with their beliefs. You can’t trigger this move by being subtle -- you must openly call on them to do so. When characters in Avatar: The Last Airbender or The Legend of Korra tell people to their face or in front of others that they need to step up or act a certain way by appealing to their beliefs or using their own words against them, they’re calling someone out!
When you make this move, you need to shift your own balance away from center first -- this represents your character taking a strong position & standing up for what they believe in. You then name the principle you’re calling on your target to live up to, and roll with the value of that principle -- meaning you roll with their balance, not your own. Someone with a strong belief in their principle is easier to push in this way, while someone whose worldview has shifted away from a belief is much harder to reach.
Remember, you need to name your target’s principle to make this move -- you need to know exactly how to appeal to their beliefs. If you already know someone’s principle (like another PC or an NPC whose principle you’ve learned through another move), you’re good to go. If you think you know an NPC’s principle and call them out, you can still try to name their principle. If you’re close enough that you essentially name the same idea, you can still make this move even if you’re not exactly correct about the phrasing. The GM is the final arbiter of whether or not you are close enough. For example, if an NPC’s principle is Justice & you call on them to live up to their principle of Law, the GM may decide it’s close enough.
On a hit, your words land & your target is called to act as you say -- but they still don’t have to do it, & you have not mind-controlled them somehow! Your target still has the agency to choose to do or not do what you called on them to do, even as they feel the pull of their principles. If they don’t choose to do what you call them to do, they must mark a condition as they feel internal conflict between what they want & their obligation. On a roll of 10+, that’s where things end, but on a 7–9, your target gets a dig at you as well that forces you to let them shift your balance in turn however they want (unless you mark a fatigue). If you mark a fatigue, you’re exerting yourself to rebut or ignore their push.
On a miss, you still call your target out -- but they not only deflect your words, they turn the moment to focus on you instead, pressuring you to act in accordance with 1 of your principles! Your words either don’t connect with them or they redirect your attempt to pressure them. This doesn’t have to be hostile or aggressive but just like when you call someone out, their response has weight to it. When the Hammer misses calling out a community leader to stand up to some local gangs, the community leader responds that attacking the gang will only make them angrier; she’ll take help resolving the situation but they demand the Hammer live up to their principle of Care, making them promise to negotiate with the gang instead of escalating to violence. The Hammer needs to either accept the NPC’s terms or mark a condition & keep their own counsel.
Note that on a miss, you’re pushed to act in accordance with one of your principles but you aren’t being called out. The decision to either do as you’re requested or mark a condition is built into this move’s outcome. This means if you roll a miss to call someone out, you can’t deny a callout to refuse the demand they make as a result.

**Deny a Callout**
When you deny an NPC calling on you to live up to your principle, roll with that principle. On a hit, act as they say or mark 1-fatigue. On a 10+, their words hit hard; you must also shift your balance towards the called-on principle. On a miss, you stand strong; clear a condition, clear 1-fatigue, or shift your balance, your choice.
NPCs can, & will, call on you to live up to 1 of your principles just as you can call them out. When they do, you must choose: accept their words & do what they demand (whether you like it or not), or reject them & make this move. The NPC doesn’t have to know your principle; it’s up to the GM to tell you when their demand for action lines up with your internal struggles.
When an NPC calls on you to live up to 1 of your principles and you deny them, you must roll with the called-on principle. If you’re the Idealist & have +2 Forgiveness & -2 Action, you roll with +2 if you reject a call to Forgiveness or -2 to reject a call to Action. But this move is reversed from most -- if you deny a callout, then you want to roll low, not high. This means that it’s easier to reject NPCs calling on you to live up to the principle you’re neglecting...and much harder to resist living up to what you believe in.
Unlike almost every other move, you have the most control when you roll a miss to deny a callout -- a miss means that you hold your ground in the face of the NPC’s influence. In fact, your resilience allows you to either clear a condition, clear 1-fatigue, or shift your balance however you choose.
If you choose to shift your balance, you might shift away from the called-on principle to show them what you truly believe in or to outright reject their demands. You might shift towards the called-on principle instead, showing that while you chose not to follow their demands or their interpretation of the principle, your commitment to that core idea remains strong.
If you roll a hit when denying a callout, they make you stop in your tracks; maybe you know deep down that they’re right, or maybe they hit a sore spot. You have a choice: either act as they say or mark 1-fatigue. On a 10+, you need to choose & you also shift your balance towards the called-on principle.

**Resist Shifting Your Balance**
When you resist an NPC shifting your balance, roll. On a hit, you maintain your current balance in spite of their words or deeds. On a 10+, choose 2. On a 7–9, choose 1.
• Clear a condition or mark growth by immediately acting to prove them wrong
• Shift your balance towards the opposite principle
• Learn what their principle is (if they have one); if you already know, take +1 forward against them 
On a miss, they know just what to say to throw you off balance. Mark a condition, & the GM shifts your balance twice.

Most NPCs are complex characters with their own beliefs, goals, and feelings -- just like your characters! As you interact with them, they may try to get you to see the world the way they do, shifting your balance as they provide mentorship, stand up for their beliefs, try to manipulate you, or tell you how things really are. In these moments they want to change your mind or challenge your beliefs, rather than call on you to act immediately a certain way (as with calling someone out). It’s more than just offering a different opinion -- shifting your balance represents actively changing what you think (well-intentioned or not). You can either let them shape you & move your balance track in the direction of their choice... or push back against them & resist shifting your balance.
When you resist shifting your balance, you’re not just choosing to ignore an NPC’s words -- you’re rejecting any shift to your balance, the current state of your principles & beliefs. If you accept their words, you’re open to changing your perspective at this moment; if you resist them, you’re sticking to your guns.
To resist, you roll without a modifier -- no stat applies. On a hit, you hold strong despite their actions & words, which means that your balance stays where it is, & you choose one response from the list of options (or 2 if you rolled a 10+).
If you choose to "clear a condition or mark growth," you must immediately act to prove the NPC wrong. For example, if they try to shift your Guardian towards Self-Reliance by asserting that your friends will always let you down, & you successfully resist them, you need to show that NPC they’re wrong -- perhaps by demonstrating your Trust in your companions. Doing so either reinvigorates you (by clearing a condition) or represents a moment of introspection that helps you learn about yourself or change (by marking growth).
If you choose to "shift your balance towards the opposite principle," you’re not just denying the NPC’s attempt to change your beliefs; you’re actively asserting beliefs opposed to what they have said. You don’t have to do anything special in the fiction, but it’s usually good to tell your group how they can tell you’ve steeled yourself in the face of the NPC’s influence.
If you choose to "learn what their principle is," you gain insight into the NPC as they try to push you towards (or away from) one of your principles. Their attempt to shift your balance reveals their own underlying philosophy, or (if you already know it) deepens your understanding of it. Once you know an NPC’s principle, you can start to make moves that require knowing it, like calling out the NPC (page 138).
If you try to resist shifting your balance & roll a miss, however, the NPC’s words hit you extra hard. Maybe they know how to push your buttons, use your fears or insecurities against you, or just say the right thing at the right time. To reflect being struck in an emotional pressure point, you must mark a condition & shift your balance twice in the direction of the GM’s choice. Almost always, that lines up with the NPC’s chosen direction -- their words needled you & changed you, after all -- but it’s possible the GM might shift you twice in the opposite direction if the fiction fits. It’s also possible that this causes you to lose your balance!
Remember that you can only resist shifting your balance when an NPC tries to shift your balance. Usually this only happens during regular play, when they say something to you -- not as the result of another move. If another PC counsels you or challenges your thinking, they can try to guide & comfort you but you only shift your balance if they roll a 10+, or if you reject them in response. If an NPC shifts your balance during a combat exchange by Testing Your Balance (page 156), you can’t resist shifting your balance. The rapid pace of an exchange means there isn’t enough time to reject or process the shift caused by any given technique.

**Lose Your Balance**
If your balance shifts past the end of the track, you lose your balance. You obsess over that principle to a degree that’s not healthy for you or anyone around you. Choose 1 of the following:
• Give in or submit to your opposition
• Lose control of yourself in a destructive & harmful way
• Take an extreme action in line with the principle, then flee 
Afterward, when you’ve had some time to recover & re-center yourself, shift your center 1 step towards the principle you exceeded & clear all your conditions & fatigue. Reset your balance to your new center.

As you become more set in your ways & beliefs, you may find yourself leaning towards 1 principle more than another. This can be a good thing! Your firm belief in 1 of your principles makes it beneficial to live up to your principle when it really matters. However, you’re teetering on the edge of danger -- you’ll have a hard time denying a callout on that strong principle, & if you shift your balance further, you lose your balance. When you do, you become so obsessed with that principle that you end up causing problems for yourself & others. You lose your balance.
You can only lose your balance on-screen. In all cases, when you lose your balance, you are in some way removed from the action afterward. Sometimes you might flee. Sometimes you might fall unconscious. You might still be in the scene, but you’re not an active participant -- you can’t respond to someone if they try to guide & comfort you, & you can’t trigger most moves or be proactive, at least not yet. It’s a bit like being taken out -- you’re not an active agent until you’ve had some time to recover.
If you choose to “give in or submit to your opposition,” you’re so overcome by the principle that you’re overwhelmed & resign to giving up rather than resist further. If your opposition wants you to do something -- instead of just surrendering -- then choosing this option means you follow through on whatever they want you to do. In order to choose this option, you need opposition to give in to; you can’t give up or give in without any opposing force.
If you “lose control of yourself in a destructive & harmful way,” your obsession with that principle causes you to lash out at the people & world around you. You might lose control of your firebending & erupt a burst of flame as you vent your frustration, or become so overcome with your belief in Progress that you destroy a priceless heirloom of your lineage. Whatever happens, something is destroyed or someone gets hurt (physically or emotionally).
If you “take an extreme action in line with the principle & flee,” your temporary fixation on that principle means you do something drastic in pursuit of that belief. This is a catch-all for other kinds of extreme, intense actions you might take that show your over-commitment to your principle. Whatever you do has to be costly and consequential -- it’s not extreme if you come out in more or less the same place on the other side. After you take the action, you flee the scene, & you can’t return -- you’re out until the scene changes.
If your center shifts past +3 or -3, then it might be time to change your playbook or retire your character. See page 219 for more on the ways your character’s story might shift dramatically.

**Growth Questions**
At the end of each session, each player answers the following questions:
• Did you learn something challenging, exciting, or complicated about the world?
• Did you stop a dangerous threat or solve a community problem?
• Did you guide a companion towards balance or end the session at your center?
Each player also answers their playbook’s unique personal growth question. For each “yes”, mark growth. When you have marked 4 growth, you take a growth advancement.

Growth questions point at core lessons the PCs can learn about themselves & the world, pushing them to be open-minded heroes. The core 3 questions can be answered collectively as a group, while each PC’s individual playbook question is answered individually. For more on growth questions, see page 209.

**Training Move**
When you spend time with a teacher learning & training in a new technique, roll with modifiers from the following questions:
• Is your balance in line with your center or are you free of conditions? If yes, take +1.
• Do you & your teacher share at least one background? If yes, take +1.
• Does your teacher agree with your reasons for training & learning? If no, take -1.
• Is the technique easy to grasp based on your current training, experience, & skills? If no, take -1.
On a hit, you learn the technique, & your master shifts your balance. On a 10+, you learn it with ease, & it takes as little time as possible. On a 7–9, it either takes more time than normal, or you must mark 2 conditions. On a miss, you can’t learn the technique yet because you need another lesson before you can grasp its full use. Your master will tell you what additional task you must undertake to put yourself into the correct state of mind; do it, & you learn the technique.

The training move is all about acquiring new techniques by studying with a master. It almost always requires you to have a teacher, & it requires you to have the appropriate training to learn the technique. For more on the training move, see page 212. For more on techniques you might learn, see Appendix A.

But balance means appreciating that other people are just as complex as you are, not merely obstacles or pawns. Tell the GM how you solve an intractable problem or calm a terrible conflict by relating to dangerous people on a human level.
**Principles**
*Results vs Restraint*
The Adamant’s 2 principles reflect their self-awareness & their attempt to manage their best & worst impulses. 
The Adamant’s *Results* principle is all about their drive to change things for the better & have it stick. An Adamant with a high Results principle cares more about getting results than what it might cost. They’re pragmatic to a fault, willing to make sacrifices & tough choices to achieve the things they deem worth it.
The Adamant’s *Restraint* principle, on the other hand, is all about their desire to hold back & be careful, to think & comprehend & plan instead of bulling ahead. An Adamant with a high Restraint principle still wants to achieve the same ends, but they’re not doing so at any cost. They consider different paths & are more willing to compromise or accept imperfect solutions if it means avoiding other terrible consequences.
The Adamant’s Moment of Balance pushes them to manage their principles to pursue Results without giving up Restraint. They find that place of equilibrium in seeing other people as people, not just as pawns to achieve an end...but then understanding that those people can still help achieve results, perhaps more so if they’re treated equally. The Adamant’s Moment of Balance has them treating other dangerous people empathetically & humanely, & achieving their results anyway.
**The Lodestar**
There’s only 1 person you often let past your emotional walls.
Name your lodestar (choose a PC to start): 
You can shift your lodestar to someone new when they guide & comfort you & you open up to them, or when you guide & comfort them & they open up to you. If you do choose to shift your lodestar, clear a condition.
When you shut down someone vulnerable to harsh words or icy silence, shift your balance toward Results & roll with Results. On a hit, they mark a condition & you may clear the same condition. On a 10+, they also cannot shift your balance or call you out for the rest of the scene. On a miss, they have exactly the right retort; mark a condition & they shift your balance. You cannot use this on your lodestar.
When your lodestar shifts your balance or calls you out, you cannot resist it. Treat an NPC lodestar calling you out as if you rolled a 10+, & a PC lodestar calling you out as if they rolled a 10+.
When you consult your lodestar for advice on a problem (or permission to use your preferred solution), roll with Restraint. On 10+ take all 3; on a 7–9 choose 2:
• You see the wisdom of their advice. They shift your balance; follow their advice & they shift your balance again.
• The conversation bolsters you. Clear a condition or 2-fatigue.
• They feel at ease offering their opinion. They clear a condition or 2-fatigue.
On a miss, something about their advice infuriates you. Mark a condition or have the GM shift your balance twice.
**The Adamant’s Lodestar**
As the Adamant, your lodestar is the person you listen to & rely on to set you straight. You let them in & keep others at bay. Make sure your lodestar is another PC when you create your character.
**Shutting someone down**, as described within your lodestar feature, represents the way that your Adamant character tends not to let people besides the lodestar into their heart. Shutting someone down can be useful for you to inflict conditions & sometimes clear them, but it’s important to note that you can never use it on your lodestar. When your lodestar tries to call you out on your principle, it’s treated in the worst possible way for you -- you have no way to resist it without cost.
On the other hand, you can gain advice from your lodestar that can actually help you accomplish your goals...when you have a high enough Restraint to take the time to actually talk to them. Note that only the first option -- they shift your balance; follow their advice & they shift your balance again -- produces an effect that depends upon you actually following their advice.
You can change who your lodestar is over the course of play. If you guide & comfort someone & they open up to you, you can make that person your new lodestar. If someone guides & comforts you & you open up to them, you can make that person your new lodestar. In either case, if the person being guided & comforted doesn’t open up, you can’t switch. When you do switch, make sure to clear a condition above & beyond any you might clear for the guide & comfort.
**Growth Question**
*Did you seek support or guidance from others?*
The Adamant’s growth question is all about learning to see other people as sources of wisdom & understanding. When the Adamant seeks support or guidance from others, they learn to temper their own drive with the ideas of others.

THE BOLD
*The Bold fights to live up to their self-image & earn others’ trust & confidence. Play the Bold if you want to build your reputation & leadership skills.*
Self-doubting, boastful, clever, curious. The Bold is sure that they have it in them to be someone great -- a great warrior, an exceptional artist, a master bender -- even if they aren’t really there yet, even if others make sure that the Bold knows they aren’t there yet. They will be, someday. They just need to work up to it, okay? They’re working up to it!
The Bold is trying to prove themselves. They may present to the world a confident, capable face, may even boast about their excellence -- but that’s nearly always a facade, an attempt to sell themselves on their own skills as much as to convince anyone else. But at the same time, the Bold isn’t all talk -- they are committed to making the world better, & especially for their friends, their family, & the people they care about.
**Demeanor Options**: Impatient, Sensitive, Affable, Enthusiastic, Talkative, Impetuous
**History**
• Why do you feel the need to prove yourself so badly?
• Who epitomizes the kind of big, bold figure you hope to be?
• Whose approval do you think you will never attain?
• What token or symbol do you wear to prove you are serious?
• Why are you committed to this group or purpose?
**Connections**
•  scoffs at me & my plans; 1 day I’ll show them what I can do.
•  has a pretty good head on their shoulders; they’re a great sounding board for my ideas.
**Moment of Balance**
The greatest heroes of your age may have overwhelming confidence, but balance isn’t about pursuing greatness for the sake of greatness. You find a way to stand with your companions like no 1 else ever could. Tell the GM how you strike down an impossibly strong enemy or obstacle to protect your friends from harm as the best version of yourself.
**Principles**
*Loyalty vs Confidence*
The Bold struggles between the principles of Loyalty & Confidence. 
Their *Loyalty* principle emphasizes how much they are committed to others, & in turn, how much they make themselves subordinate to others, putting the needs of their friends & companions far ahead of their own goals & feelings. A high Loyalty Bold cares more about others, how those others see the Bold, & what those others want or need than they care about their own needs.
Their *Confidence* principle emphasizes their belief in themselves, their own abilities, & their own status. A confident Bold takes action decisively, demands the respect due them, & makes their own decisions independently of others. A high Confidence Bold is likely to chart their own path -- even when their friends might want them to choose a different way forward -- seizing the day & taking risks that pay off in big ways!
The Bold tries to balance these 2 principles by finding ways to be confident without overriding or ignoring their commitments to others, by finding ways to be dutiful to those they care about without subordinating their own desires. The Bold’s Moment of Balance exemplifies this; they find a way to be absolutely amazing, entirely self-assured & capable, as they defend their friends & companions. They find their own way in the service of others, proving they can do much more than others expected while staying true to their friends’ needs.
**Legacy of Excellence**
You have dedicated yourself to accomplishing great, exciting deeds & becoming worthy of the trust others place in you. Choose 4 drives to mark at the start of play. When you fulfill a marked drive, strike it out, & mark growth or clear a condition. When your 4 marked drives are all struck out, choose & mark 4 new drives. When all drives are struck out, change playbooks or accept a position of great responsibility & retire from a life of adventure.
 successfully lead your companions in battle
 give your affection to someone worthy
 start a real fight with a dangerous master
 do justice to a friend or mentor’s guidance
 take down a dangerous threat all on your own
 openly outperform an authority figure
 save a friend’s life
 get a fancy new outfit
 earn the respect of an adult you admire
 openly call out a friend’s unworthy actions
 form a strong relationship with a new master
 stop a fight with calm words
 sacrifice your pride or love for a greater good
 defend an inhabited place from dire threats
 stand up to someone who doesn’t respect you
 make a friend live up to a principle they have neglected
 show mercy or forgiveness to a dangerous person
 stand up to someone abusing their power
 tame or befriend a dangerous beast or rare creature
 pull off a ridiculous stunt
**The Bold’s Legacy of Excellence**
Your Legacy of Excellence is all about doing impressive things that others will remember & might even talk about down the line. They don’t have to be bombastic -- stopping a fight with calm words is still impressive & shows you coming into your own.
You & the GM should agree when you have fulfilled a drive, but ultimately the decision is more yours than the GM’s. “Fulfilling a drive” means that you honestly feel you have achieved that desire, that goal, & can move on, & ultimately, you’re the final arbiter of whether or not that happened.
Remember you can’t pick more drives until you’ve accomplished the initial 4 you chose; when you pick your next four, the cycle begins again. If you have a drive that really doesn’t feel right anymore, but you don’t think you’re going to fulfill it, then you can work with the GM to change it at the end of the session.
If you run out of drives, that’s a good sign it’s about time for you to switch playbooks!
**Growth Question**
*Did you express vulnerability by admitting you were wrong or that you should have listened to someone you ignored?*
The Bold’s growth question focuses on the idea of learning by humbling themselves, admitting they were wrong & seeking help from others. They can still ultimately become more confident thanks to this help -- learning to fight like a Kyoshi Warrior is a boon to their self-confidence -- but they have to humble themselves to seek aid first!

THE GUARDIAN
The Guardian defends someone close to them, steadfast & watchful. Play the Guardian if you want to be the first to see danger coming & the last line of defense.
Tough, cynical, protective, devoted. The Guardian is a protector of 1 other person -- their ward -- utterly determined to keep them safe & sound against all threats & dangers. Whether or not that person wants protection is not always as important to the Guardian as it should be!
The Guardian knows how dangerous the world can be & is determined to keep someone else safe from that danger. It’s an altruistic impulse & a selfish 1 at the same time -- they want to help someone, protect them...but that desire comes from feeling no 1 else is trustworthy except the Guardian.
**Demeanor Options**: Harsh, Serious, Polite, Quiet, Suspicious, Cautious
**History**
• What pushed you to assume responsibility for the people you care about?
• Whom have you protected for so long...but maybe doesn’t need you anymore?
• Who used to be in your circle of trust before they betrayed you?
• What tattered garment or adornment reminds you of those you protect...or failed to protect?
• Why are you committed to this group or purpose?
**Connections**
•  is my ward -- they need me to have their back, end of story.
•  looks like they’re more than capable without my help; I’m glad some of us can take care of ourselves.
**Moment of Balance**
You’ve sworn to protect the people you care about, but balance is about finding your own place in the world as well. You know what you’re capable of accomplishing, & you step up to show the world your unique strength. Tell the GM how you put your own life on the line to defeat a villain or danger that seems unstoppable.
**Principles**
*Self-Reliance vs Trust*
The Guardian’s struggle is between the principles of Self-Reliance & Trust. 
Their *Self-Reliance* principle is all about a mistrust of others & the world. The Guardian knows they can handle problems on their own...but they have a hard time trusting other people to handle themselves. It’s not just about the Guardian’s own confidence; it’s about their difficulty letting others help or handle things on their own. A Self-Reliant Guardian is very capable & confident, but also likely cynical, doubting others & liable to handle any problem by themselves.
Their *Trust* principle is about putting faith in others, letting them handle problems without the Guardian’s presence or aid. As Trust goes up, the Guardian comes to believe in a greater & stronger connection to others, their companions especially, & comes to rely on them. A Trusting Guardian knows their companions have their back, but might trust to the point of complacency, missing important details or warning signs that a more Self-Reliant Guardian would pick up on.
The Guardian tries to balance these 2 principles by finding a place where they are acting, working to keep the people they care about safe, but also trusting those people to live their own lives & keep themselves safe most of the time. The Guardian’s Moment of Balance exemplifies this; they act to defeat some dangerous villain or threat, putting their own life on the line & relying on themselves, but putting enough trust into others that they don’t need to hold back.
**Protector’s Burden**
You take it upon yourself to protect the people around you in general, but you have someone in particular you keep safe.
***Name your ward*** (choose a PC to start): 
When they mark a condition in front of you, mark fatigue or a condition. Your ward can always call on you to live up to your principle -- without shifting their balance away from center -- & they take +1 to do it.
At the beginning of each session, roll, taking +1 for each yes:
• Do you believe your ward listens to you more often than not?
• Have you recently protected them or helped them with a problem?
• Is there an immediate threat to your ward that you are aware of?
On a 7–9, hold 1. On a 10+, hold 2. At any time, spend the hold to:
• Take a 10+ without rolling on any move to defend or protect them
• Track them down even if they are hidden or avoiding you
• Figure out what they’re up to without them knowing
On a miss, hold 1, but...you’re drifting apart on different paths. By the end of the session, you must choose one:
• Decide you’re the only 1 who can keep them safe; shift your balance twice toward Self-Reliance & keep them as your ward
• Decide they can handle life without your protection; shift your balance twice toward Trust & switch your ward to a new person
You may also switch your ward if they leave play or are no longer present for some reason. When you switch your ward, you can switch to an NPC (if the GM agrees).
**The Guardian’s Protector’s Burden**
Your ward is the person you have committed yourself to keeping safe. When your ward marks a condition in front of you, you feel it & must mark a fatigue or a condition as well. This only matters if it happens in front of you, however -- if they mark a condition in your absence, you aren’t required to mark anything.
For the start of session roll, you are the final arbiter of the answers; if you believe that a particular NPC is a threat, then you take +1 for the third question, even if others disagree. On a miss, you must choose to recommit to guarding your ward or trust them enough to let them go. You must decide by the end of the session & shift your balance accordingly. The decision is ultimately yours -- being a Guardian can be an overbearing role & doesn’t require you to take your ward’s opinion into account...although you should check in with the other player!
When you spend your hold to take a 10+ to defend or protect your ward, the most important idea here is again your belief. If you believe what you are doing protects your ward, then spending the hold is warranted.
Spending a hold to track your ward down indicates your general under-standing of them, & your overarching skeptical, watchful nature. You always have a lead on your ward...spending a hold just means you follow it quickly.
Spending a hold to figure out what they’re up to also applies your understanding of them to find answers, asking around, looking at evidence, checking where they’ve been, etc. You firm up a pretty clear picture, all without ever needing to directly ask your ward what they’ve been doing.
**Growth Question**
*Did you pursue a desire or goal of your own, outside of protecting others?*
The Guardian’s growth question is about edging toward a place of self-development, self-awareness -- not just self-reliance, but a belief that takes the Guardian past only protecting people & toward making decisions for themselves.

THE HAMMER
*The Hammer is strong, tough, & looking for a deserving face to punch. Play the Hammer if you want to grapple with what force can & can’t solve.*
Brash, daring, forceful, foolhardy. The Hammer is a powerful fighter, a dangerous enemy, & a blunt object -- they don’t really have that many additional strategies or approaches beyond “punch it hard.” They constantly face the difficulty of wanting to make the world better, to serve real justice & protect the innocent...all without a particularly versatile toolset.
The Hammer is, at heart, a hero. They’re trying to do good! They’re not just a bully or a fighter -- they serve a strong belief in right & wrong! They’ve just found punching a useful or appropriate response to badness, & they got real good at it! But now that they’ve joined this group & are pursuing an important, larger purpose, they are encountering problems they can’t punch into submission -- foes against whom combat isn’t even an option, let alone the right option.
**Demeanor Options**: Playful, Blunt, Quiet, Loud, Excessive, Determined
**History**
• What injustice has driven you to use your strength for good?
• Who represents the kind of positive strength & force you want to embody?
• Who tried their best to teach you restraint, calm, & thoughtfulness?
• What fragile trinket or heirloom do you keep & protect?
• Why are you committed to this group or purpose?
**Connections**
•  has a way to solve problems with words instead of fists -- it’s really impressive!
• I worry  won’t be able to hold their own when things get tough. I’m going to toughen them up!
**Moment of Balance**
You can knock down every wall in the world, but balance isn’t found in conquest & destruction. You know some walls need to stand to keep people safe. Tell the GM how you put yourself directly in the path of an inescapable threat to completely protect someone or something from harm.
**Principles**
*Force vs Care*
The Hammer’s struggle is between the principles of Force & Care. The Hammer is drawn between a desire to use overwhelming, direct force to enact change on the world, & a desire to be careful, to use the right application of will & strength at the right moment. 
Their *Force* principle is all about their desire to smash their way through problems & foes. Some obstacles can only be bulldozed! Some foes deserve to be destroyed! The Hammer is very good at punching their way to victory, & the Force principle represents that impulse.
Their *Care* principle is all about their belief that the world is worth saving, protecting, & serving...and their desire to pull their punches so they don’t smash all of it. The use of Force has an unfortunate tendency to leave things broken & shattered -- perhaps even to snap things when they could have been saved, redeemed, or rescued. Care is about the Hammer coming to understand & appreciate the need to prevent collateral damage, sometimes to give others a chance to make new decisions & better themselves instead of being broken.
The Hammer tries to balance these 2 principles by finding when it’s time to hit hard, & when it’s time to pull a punch. Their Moment of Balance is all about successfully finding that equilibrium -- punching hard to act as a wall & protect something worth protecting. Breaking & destroying isn’t the goal in that moment, so much as the goal is saving something they care about...but the Hammer is ready to hit harder than ever to do that.
**Bringing Them Down**
You always have an adversary, 1 who represents the things you’re trying to smash through -- tyranny, inequality, war; larger & more dangerous concepts that, to you at least, this 1 person embodies. Your adversary is someone significant & powerful -- someone who actually deserves the amount of force you can bring to bear.
***Name your adversary***: 
Choose a goal you have for your adversary:
 capture them
 discredit them
 depose them
 restrain them
 expose them
 exile them
Take -1 ongoing to plead with, trick, or guide & comfort your adversary.
***Changing Your adversary***: You can change your adversary any time you mark a condition, or at the end of each session. When you do, choose an appropriate goal, & the GM shifts your balance twice to match your new adversary & your new goal. When you successfully accomplish your goal & defeat your adversary, take a growth advancement & choose a new adversary.
***Fighting Your adversary***: When you enter into a fight against your adversary, clear all fatigue & become Inspired. When you select any combat approach against your adversary, mark fatigue to roll with conditions marked instead of your normal stat.
**The Hammer’s Bringing Them Down**
Part of why the Hammer encounters such difficulty at the start of your campaign is that they are up against an adversary, a real foe who deserves to be defeated but who cannot be struck down like all the rest. The adversary represents an even larger, even more invulnerable force -- tyranny, inequality, war, & so on -- but this person, you can face & fight.
Your goal for your adversary is 1 that you can’t achieve just by punching, for whatever reason. If your goal is to capture your adversary, then they’re elusive & incredibly hard to find & reach. If your goal is to depose them, then the very system that props your adversary up is invested in their continued rein. If your goal is to restrain them, then they can weasel out of whatever restraints you impose.
Changing your adversary when you mark a condition almost always means that
your new choice of adversary is tied to whatever caused you to mark that condition.
Changing your adversary at the end of the session is a good chance to realign when the events of the session had changed your goals. If you do change at the end of a session, remember that you can’t lose your balance off-screen (see page 141).
“Successfully accomplishing your goal & defeating your adversary” should be pretty clear to everyone, including yourself & the GM. If there’s any dissent about whether you really defeated your adversary, then you most likely haven’t yet.
Entering a fight against your adversary means they must be present & active -- they don’t have to be the primary opposition, but you’re not entering a fight against them if it’s just their minions, for example. When you roll with conditions marked instead of your normal stat, your maximum bonus is +5.
**Growth Question**
*Did you make progress towards your goal against your adversary?*
The Hammer’s growth question drives them to always aim themselves at their adversary. “Make progress toward your goal” means they took some step to achieve their goal against their adversary, whether or not the end is in sight.

THE ICON
*The Icon comes from an ancient tradition & inherits some serious standards to live up to. Play the Icon if you want to be torn between your heart & your duty.*
Torn, fun-loving, anxious, dutiful. The Icon was raised to fulfill a particular duty & role in their society -- an important role, an honored role, a role that so many others, from adults to children, envy. But the Icon isn’t sure they want the role. They weren’t given any real choice in the matter; it’s their role according to destiny, tradition, prophecy, or some other impulse that guided the hands of their parents, mentors, or guardians.
The Icon’s role is tied to some culture or tradition, so be sure to think about exactly what their role is & how it connects to them when making the character. Tying the Icon into the scope of your game is a good idea -- if your scope is the whole of the world, then the Icon’s role & associated cultural tradition can be world-spanning, but if the scope of your game is Republic City, the Icon’s role can be much more restricted to the city’s limits.
The Icon has had the massive import of their role impressed upon them from a young age; they have always known how important the duties were. Now, they have all of that responsibility foisted upon them, & where once they could be themselves & live their life, everyone expects them to be something else now.
**Demeanor Options**: Naive, Playful, Needy, Sad, Haughty, Grave
**History**
• What tradition do you represent as its icon, & why can’t you set down the role?
• Who was your chief mentor, teaching you the nature of your burden & its value?
• Who showed you that even with the weight of your burden, you could still find ways to play?
• What token of your burden & tradition do you always carry?
• Why are you committed to this group or purpose?
**Connections**
•  seems to not fully understand what it means that I’m the icon of my tradition...and I kind of like feeling free around them.
•  makes me feel better about my responsibilities & my burden with a smile & a few kind words.
**Moment of Balance**
Others have laid a path for you that you cannot escape, but balance means you understand the limits of their vision. You make the role your own in this moment, charting a new path for yourself & your tradition. Tell the GM how your new understanding of your burdens forges a new way forward for everyone.
**Principles**
*Role vs Freedom*
The Icon is split between the 2 principles of their Role & their Freedom. 
The Icon’s *Role* principle represents their commitment to & belief in all the duties & meaning of their role. The higher their Role, the more they believe in those duties & the greater their adherence to that job. An Icon with a high Role integrates their sense of identity with the role; they begin to see the world through the eyes of someone fulfilling a duty first & foremost, long before they think of their own needs.
The Icon’s *Freedom* principle represents their desire to be free to make their own choices, act as they want, & just have fun. It’s the freedom other people enjoy -- at least, those people who are not defined by such a rigid set of important responsibilities. An Icon with a high Freedom tries to avoid their role & its duties, often with significant consequences. They may try to foist their work off on other people or institutions, or just let the work go completely undone to pursue their own fun adventures.
The Icon tries to find a balance between these 2 principles by defining themselves & their role all at once. Their Moment of Balance reflects them not simply assuming the role as others have described it, but remaking the role on their own -- exerting the freedom to choose the role & to define it their own way. They may end up rejecting the role as others conceive it...but they may also reinvent the role itself in ways that inspire others to commit to the idea of the role even further.
**Burden & Tradition**
You are an icon of your burden & tradition. You are expected to be its exemplar, its single most important representative, trained up from a young age & saddled with the weight of history. You have been told that you are vital to the world.
Choose 3 responsibilities of your burden & tradition you are expected to assume:
*Protecting humanity from natural disasters & dark spirits; destroying dangerous creatures; overthrowing tyrants; serving & defending rightful rulers; performing rituals; providing aid & succor to the downtrodden; searching for hidden histories & artifacts; guarding nature from threats & destruction; safekeeping records & relics.*
Choose 3 prohibitions of your burden & tradition:
*Never refuse an earnest request for help; never express great emotion; never run from a fight; never start a fight; never deny someone knowledge or truth; never use your role for gain or profit; never intervene in a community without invitation; never withhold forgiveness; never steal or cheat.*
***Live Up to Your Role***: When you live up to your Role through the responsibilities of your burden & tradition despite opposition or danger, shift your balance toward Role instead of marking fatigue, & clear fatigue equal to your Role (minimum 0-fatigue).
***Break Tradition***: When you directly & openly break a prohibition of your burden & tradition, mark a condition, shift your balance twice towards Freedom, & mark growth.
***End of Session***: At the end of each session, answer these after your standard growth questions.
• Did I uphold a responsibility? *If yes, shift balance toward Role & clear a condition.*
• Did I break a prohibition? *If yes, shift balance toward Freedom. Underline 1 prohibition you broke during the session. If it’s already underlined, cross it out -- it doesn’t mean anything to you to break it again.*
**The Icon’s Burden & Tradition**
The Icon’s Burden & Tradition feature defines the particulars of the role they’re expected to fulfill. Every role has 3 major responsibilities & 3 major prohibitions; there might be countless minor duties & prohibitions, but the Icon had these ones drilled into them. Their responsibilities are jobs the Icon is expected to perform, for their society, their culture, or the world as a whole. Their prohibitions are actions meant to be avoided at all times.
Whichever responsibilities & prohibitions you choose, make sure you’re interested in those aspects of play. By making them a responsibility or a prohibition, you ensure these actions matter to your game. For example, if you choose “never refuse an earnest request for help,” you’re saying you want to get into situations to do just that. If you can’t see yourself ever refusing an earnest request for help -- or you’re not interested in the GM making moves that push you into situations where you might refuse -- then don’t pick that prohibition.
Living up to your Role triggers the core balance move live up to your principle. But whereas that move only requires you to take action in accordance with the values of a principle, for your special benefits to apply, you must do so “despite opposition or danger,” meaning that you don’t trigger the effects unless you actually adhere to the responsibilities of your Burden & Tradition in the face of opposition or danger. The benefit is that you can shift your balance toward Role instead of marking fatigue, & you get to clear fatigue equal to your Role after shifting. Because you shift your Role first, you get to use your improved Role both for the clearing of fatigue & for the substitute stat.
The min fatigue you clear is 0 -- if your Role isn’t positive after the shift, you don’t clear anything, but you don’t mark fatigue for a negative principle, either. You can still live up to your principle normally without triggering this effect.
Breaking tradition means directly & openly violating a prohibition of your Burden & Tradition. It should be clear when you do so, & it should be observable to others -- if you break a prohibition secretly or known only to you, it doesn’t trigger this effect. If you’re unsure whether or not you’re directly & openly violating a prohibition of your Burden & Tradition, ask the GM what they think. & the GM should do their part to warn you when they think you’re about to do that, in case you don’t know. “Directly & openly” means that you can’t stumble, accidentally, into breaking a tradition -- you have to do so intentionally.
When you do break tradition, you mark a condition to represent the toll of violating the rules so ingrained in you, but then you shift your balance twice toward Freedom & mark growth.
For your end of session questions, you & the GM should work together to have the same answer to the questions. You are the final arbiter -- the answers represent your internal understanding of your responsibilities & prohibitions -- but the GM can push you on whether or not you really acted as you should have. In both cases, remember that any balance shift can’t cause you to lose balance off-screen. If you shift your balance at the end of the session & you would lose your balance, you instead stay at +3 in the appropriate principle.
**Growth Question**
*Did you accomplish a feat worthy of your burden & tradition?*
The Icon’s growth question points them at building upon the foundation of their role in a similar way. What matters is if they did something worthy of their burden & tradition, whether or not it adhered to any of their prohibitions or responsibilities.

THE IDEALIST
*The Idealist has a past, full of suffering & tragedy, that strengthened their beliefs. Play the Idealist if you want to awaken the hope in everyone around you.*
Noble, pained, kind, committed. The Idealist has suffered some tragedy in their past, something terrible that left them with pain & anger...but also, with hope. Even in the face of tragedy, they felt & pursued a belief that people could be great, that the world could be better. The Idealist pursues that belief, taking action to help people, connect them, & solve problems.
The Idealist still has an edge to them, however, & a capacity for unforgiveness. After all, something terrible happened to them, & it can be hard not to crave vengeance against those responsible. At their best, the Idealist can turn that drive into a push to change the world for the better. At their worst, it can drive the Idealist to extreme, dangerous action.
**Demeanor Options**: Lonely, Compassionate, Joyful, Grieving, Earnest, Resolute
**History**
• What tragedy befell you at a young age?
• Who do you hold most responsible for the tragedy? Why?
• Who helped you through your grief? What did they teach you?
• What symbol, heirloom, or mark do you carry to remind you of what you lost?
• Why are you committed to this group or purpose?

• I recognize some of the pain I have felt inside of  ; I’m going to try to help them.
•  frustrates me so much when they act without thinking about the consequences!
**Moment of Balance**
The pain of the world can be overwhelming, but balance brings peace. You bring everything around you to a stop -- villains, arguments, disaster -- & set the world right. Tell the GM how your compassionate actions end a conflict utterly & completely.
**Principles**
*Forgiveness vs Action*
The Idealist’s 2 principles of Forgiveness & Action represent these 2 poles. 
Their *Forgiveness* principle is all about their desire & ability to forgive, to move on past transgressions & offenses through empathy, understanding, & emotional catharsis. Forgiveness doesn’t mean the Idealist offers it to everyone, unambiguously -- it just means the Idealist is committed to resolving & moving on from past pain & injury. Sometimes it needs someone repentant on the other side; other times, the Idealist expressing forgiveness is more important than the perpetrator asking for it.
The Idealist’s *Action* principle, on the other hand, drives them to take action, to do things & change the world directly. Sometimes, Action expresses itself as vengeance, attempts to punish those responsible for wrongdoing. Other times, it expresses itself as using the drive toward justice to directly act & make things better, destroying dangers, protecting the innocent, & making real, immediate change.
The Idealist tries to balance these 2 principles by finding a way to both take action & make change...and to be compassionate, merciful, & forgiving. Their Moment of Balance signifies finding this perfect equilibrium. The Idealist stops the actions of others, whether through their skills & training or through their words, & finds a way to fix a major problem through compassionate action.
**Never Turn My Back**
You’ve seen sadness & grief. You’re no stranger to loss & pain. But you know the world can be a better place. & nothing happens without good people fighting for what’s right...
You have a code -- choose 3 ideals from the list to define it:
 always speak the truth
 always stand up to bullies
 always keep your promises
 never strike the first blow
 never deny a request for help
 never leave a friend behind
When you live up to your ideals at a significant cost, someone who witnessed (or hears about) your sacrifice approaches you to affirm their allegiance to your group’s purpose; write their name down on the list of allies below.
***Allies***: You can always plead with these allies -- they always care what you think; they always open up to you if you guide & comfort them; & you can call on them to live up to their principles as if you had rolled a 10+ by erasing their name from your list of allies.
**The Idealist’s Never Turn My Back**
The Idealist’s code isn’t binding the way that the Icon’s prohibitions & responsibilities might be. The code doesn’t represent rules that another has imposed on the Idealist, so much as the very ideals that they picked for themselves, the things they strive for to be the best version of themselves.
When you pick your ideals, make sure you pick things you are interested in doing in the face of difficulty. For example, if you pick “never strike the first blow,” you’re saying that you want conflicts in which you might want to strike first. Maybe you’ll face off against obnoxious, terrible enemies who try to provoke you into attacking; maybe you’ll encounter foes skilled at oblique threats, so they can do you harm without ever “striking the first blow.” If you don’t pick “never strike the first blow,” however, you’re saying you’re disinterested in conflicts about provocation & foes who can’t or shouldn’t be targeted directly.
The GM is the ultimate arbiter of whether or not you live up to your ideals at a significant cost -- the question isn’t about the Idealist’s own belief in their actions, but about whether others have heard of the sacrifice & have been impressed. The GM determines the person approaching the Idealist, who should approach sooner than later. They don’t need to have witnessed the act immediately, however -- they might just have heard about it & approach later. Either way, they are impressed with the Idealist & they appreciate their group’s purpose.
When you call on an ally to live up to their principles as if you had rolled a 10+ by erasing their name from your list of allies, it means you’re pushing your relationship with them. You’re using up some of the goodwill you’ve earned to get them to act appropriately, according to their beliefs. You can still earn that goodwill back if you again live up to your ideals at a significant cost; at the GM’s discretion, a former ally can always approach & let you write their name down again!
**Growth Question**
*Did you improve the lives of a community of average citizens or help an ordinary person with their problems?*
The Idealist’s growth question points them always toward helping people, wherever they go. Be it a whole community of average citizens or an ordinary person, the Idealist grows when they aid the innocent, the less powerful, or the needy. Their growth question won’t drive them to help the powerful or the mighty, of course.

THE PILLAR
*The Pillar is an experienced team player & leader of a famous group of warriors. Play the Pillar if you want to be a savvy tactician who binds the team together.*
Supportive, self-assured, quiet, tactical. The Pillar comes from a background in which they worked with, even led, a larger team. They know what it takes to work well with a group, & they bring that skillset to this new group of companions. Of course, they can’t just take charge & demand everyone act the way they want...right?
The Pillar is exactly that to the group, a “pillar” to hold up the rest, to support, help, & guide them. Sometimes that means the Pillar can be a quiet presence in the background; other times, it means the Pillar moves to the forefront & takes charge. The difficulty for the Pillar comes in figuring out which time is which, & what this group needs from them!
**Demeanor Options**: Confident, Lighthearted, Critical, Stern, Gentle, Warm
**History**
• How did you rise to lead a renowned squad or group?
• Who was your closest friend & confidant in the squad?
• Who never thought you deserved to lead the group?
• What uniform, heirloom, or symbol do you carry as a talisman of the group?
• Why are you committed to this group or purpose?
**Connections**
•  doesn’t really respect my accomplishments; they probably need a lesson or 2.
•  seems like they would’ve been a good candidate to be a part of my squad; I’ll look after them.
**Moment of Balance**
You define yourself as a part of a larger group, & in this moment, the group defines itself by you. You rally them, move among them, saying the right things & providing the right guidance so your group works with perfect cohesion & confidence. Tell the GM what you say to each of your companions so that in this moment, you overcome an indomitable challenge, together.
**Principles**
*Support vs Leadership*
The Pillar’s 2 principles represent these 2 approaches to supporting the group. 
The Pillar’s *Support* principle is all about intentionally moving into a supportive position, helping others in a quieter, subtler way. Expressing Support means that the Pillar is figuring out how to help others on their own path, with their own choices. A Pillar like this eases the burdens on others in less obvious, but no less important, ways.
The Pillar’s *Leadership* principle, on the other hand, is all about directly & openly guiding others to the best versions of themselves. A Pillar committed to Leadership isn’t just being quietly supportive, but tries directly to shape their companions for the better, telling them how they should act, what they should do, how they should respond to danger, etc. This kind of Pillar isn’t going to sit on the sidelines -- this kind of Pillar takes their position in the spotlight to lead by word & example.
The Pillar tries to be of most use for their friends & their group by balancing these 2 principles, acting in a leading role that supports others in their growth. Their Moment of Balance exemplifies this moment when the Pillar rallies the entire group around them. In that moment, the Pillar becomes the perfect support & the perfect leader for the whole group, helping everyone achieve their best selves all at once in perfect cohesion. Keep in mind that the Pillar’s Moment of Balance needs the group to be present to really trigger -- it’s about the whole team, not the Pillar alone.
**Squad Leader**
You were the leader of a small group of 10 or so well-trained warriors from a recognized & noble tradition.
*Where does your squad call home*? 
*Which are the most well known traits of your squad*? (choose up to 3): our weapons, our fighting style, our battle cry, our costumes, our legends, our purpose.
*What does your squad value*? (choose 2): Excellence, Justice, Duty, Mercy, Tradition, Protection
Despite being the leader, you chose to travel with your new companions for the time being, until you’ve achieved this group’s purpose. Choose where your team is without you: protecting the team’s home while you are away; protecting a powerful figure; temporarily disbanded or exiled; training & preparing for something important; journeying & doing good works throughout your scope; escorting important travelers; stationed at an important location; performing traditional or ceremonial duties.
Within any group, you serve a role both subtle & overt, sometimes leading the team, sometimes helping it glue itself together. You earn Team through your leadership style, & you spend Team through your support style. At the end of each session, you may change 1 style of leadership & 1 style of support.
Choose 2 styles of leadership. Earn 1-Team when...
 Firm: ...you openly call on a companion to live up to their principle
 Inspiring: ...you live up to your principle & roll a hit
 Diplomatic: ...you plead with an NPC for help & roll a 10+
 Empathetic: ...you guide & comfort a companion & they open up to you
 Guidance: ...you assess a situation & give a companion instructions based on the answers
 Indomitable: ...you roll a hit when you resist shifting your balance or you deny a callout
Choose 2 styles of support. Spend 1-Team when...
 Comforting: ...you spend time one-on-one in a quiet moment with a companion to clear a condition from them
 Invigorating: ...you rally a companion to action in a tense moment to clear 2-Fatigue from them.
 Defending: ...you are within reach of a companion in combat to clear a negative status from them.
 Bolstering: ...you help another companion to give them a +1 to their roll, after the roll.
 Encouraging: ...you openly endorse a friend living up to their principle to shift their balance toward that principle.
 Trusting: ...you openly endorse a friend resisting shifting their balance to give them +2, after the roll.
**The Pillar’s Squad Leader**
The Pillar is the leader of a squad, a team of 10 or so well-trained warriors, identifiable within the scope of your game -- if you’re playing an Earth Kingdom-scope game, then they’re known at least throughout the Earth Kingdom, while if you’re playing a world-scope game, then they’re known throughout the world.
For the moment, the Pillar is traveling with this group of companions, having chosen to take a leave of absence from their other team. The Pillar’s squad still exists, & they can easily show up during play. But the Pillar has still chosen to be with these companions (the other PCs) for now, helping them with their worthy goals & giving them the support & leadership they need. If the Pillar would rather depart from the PCs & go back to their other team, then it’s likely time for the Pillar to exit play. If the Pillar is NEVER going back to their other team, then it’s likely time for the Pillar to change playbooks!
The Pillar has 2 styles of leadership, ways to earn Team -- a Pillar-only special resource -- that they can then spend to help their companions through their 2 styles of support. There is no limit to the amount of Team that the Pillar can accrue, & they keep their Team until they spend it.
To earn 1 Team, trigger a move -- like openly calling on a companion to live up to their principle for Firm, or assessing a situation & giving a companion instructions based on the answers you receive for Guidance -- you can only earn 1 Team for each move rolled.
When you spend Team for a style of support, you can’t spend multiple times for the same trigger -- once per move or triggered moment, only!
Remember that you can change 1 style of leadership & 1 style of support at the end of each session, to make sure the triggers for each match your current view of how you support & lead.
**Growth Question**
*Did you help a companion find a significant success with their issues, or lead the group in finding a significant collective success?*
The Pillar’s growth question leads them to become involved in their companions’ issues directly. They grow when they help a companion achieve a success with 1 of their own issues, or when the group as a whole achieves a significant success. So the Pillar should expect to always get involved with other PCs’ business!

THE PRODIGY
*The Prodigy not only excels at their training, but has taken it even beyond their masters’ teachings. Play the Prodigy if you want to stretch the limits of your training & abilities.*
Arrogant, extraordinary, stubborn, masterful. The Prodigy is more than just capable or skilled -- they are truly extraordinary, & their skillset blows others -- even with equivalent age or training -- out of the water. They can do things that some believe are straight-up impossible. & what’s more...they know it.
The Prodigy excels at their skills & training, to an extent that likely drove any number of their teachers or peers to hate them. The Prodigy has at least 1 teacher who genuinely helped them find the full extent of what they could do, but they’ve had to become tough developing their abilities. They know how capable they are & they know what they can do; they have grown tired of being told what they can or can’t do. They find it tough to form a connection with others, especially when no 1 else can keep up with them.
**Demeanor Options**: Curious, Proud, Defensive, Resolute, Direct, Stubborn
**History**
• When did you first accomplish something your teachers thought would be impossible for you?
• Who gave you the lessons & support you needed to discover your incredible abilities?
• Who cares for you greatly but doesn’t understand your talent?
• What strange talisman or detail of your clothing plays a role in your talents?
• Why are you committed to this group or purpose?
**Connections**
•  could use training from someone who knows what they’re doing; I suppose I am up to the task.
• I’m not sure if the overtures of friendship from  make me happy, mad, or both.
**Moment of Balance**
You’ve always struggled to rely on other people -- it feels like it makes you weak. But in this moment, connection to others is the very source of your strength. You call upon your commitment to the group to push yourself beyond your limits & do the impossible. Tell the GM how you accomplish a feat no 1 ever has before to help or save your friends.
**Principles**
*Excellence vs Community*
This struggle between their own innate abilities & their ability to bond with others is at the heart of the Prodigy’s 2 principles. 
Their principle of *Excellence* emphasizes how much they believe in themselves & their own abilities, & their commitment to being the best. The Prodigy, already incredibly capable, knows they can get better still, & they know that they deserve recognition from others as being the greatest. A Prodigy with a high Excellence is both determined to be the best...and to be seen as the best.
Their principle of *Community*, on the other hand, emphasizes how lonely it can be at the top, & how the Prodigy comes to desire connection with others -- a community. Because they excel so much, they’ve likely had difficulty connecting with anybody, but a Prodigy committed to Community still tries to make those connections, to find friends or mentors or even students. After all, 1 of the best ways the Prodigy can connect with others is to make them excellent too. A Prodigy with a high Community is less concerned with beating everyone than they are with forming meaningful bonds with the people around them, lifting them up in the process.
The Prodigy tries to balance this desire for community with their desire to be the best. Their Moment of Balance is when they find that perfect equilibrium, realizing that they became better because of their community & their friends, that saving or helping their friends can drive them to greater lengths than just a selfish sense of superiority ever could.
**Extraordinary Skill**
You aren’t just capable in your area of skill & training; you’re astonishing. A true prodigy, excelling & learning far more quickly than anyone would expect. You start play with 1 additional mastered technique.
Choose 2 areas in which your mastery is particularly impressive:
 shaping
 sensing
 maneuvering
 forcing
 breaking
 guarding
When you rely on your skills & training, use a combat stance, or otherwise trigger a move while using your mastery, ignore penalties from conditions or statuses.
When you see someone use an unknown technique, if it is available to your skills & training, you may mark fatigue to shift your balance towards Excellence & take the technique as learned. You can only do this if your balance is at +1 Excellence or higher. You must still get a mastery condition from a master of the technique in order to move the technique from practiced to mastered.
When you study with a teacher to learn a new technique, shift your balance towards Community & automatically learn the technique at the practiced level (skipping learned). You cannot learn techniques by studying with a teacher if your Balance is +0 Community or lower.
When you spend time teaching a fellow companion a technique available to their skills & training, roll with Community. On a hit, you teach well enough; they learn the technique. On a 7–9, you get impatient or frustrated; choose to either take it out on them & inflict 2 conditions, or take it out on yourself & suffer 2 conditions. On a miss, you get too frustrated with their inadequacies; both of you suffer 2 conditions, & you can never try to teach them this technique again.
**The Prodigy’s Extraordinary Skill**
The Prodigy starts with 1 more mastered technique than normal. If playing with the full rules, that means the Prodigy starts with 2 mastered techniques & 1 learned technique.
The Prodigy’s extraordinary skill lives in particular areas of their training. They’re so skilled in those areas that whenever they do something using those general foci, they can ignore penalties from conditions or negative status effects.
What’s more, the Prodigy can learn & master new techniques with a rapidity beyond nearly anyone else. They can learn techniques just by seeing others use them, as long as they have +1 Excellence or higher. On the other hand, when they actually do study with a master, they can learn new techniques beginning at practiced level, skipping learned, as long as they have at least +0 Community.
In addition, the Prodigy can actually teach their fellow companions new techniques. Remember that the techniques you teach them have to be available to their skills & training, & that if you get a miss, you can never teach them that technique again. For more on teaching techniques, see page 212.
**Growth Question**
*Did you express gratitude to a companion for their presence, support, or teaching?*
The Prodigy’s growth question encourages them away from out-and-out arrogance & solitude. Whether the Prodigy emphasizes Excellence or Community, they don’t have to be annoying about how awesome they are! The Prodigy who is still able to connect with individuals, who is able to find excellence in others, is the Prodigy who grows & develops as a person.

THE ROGUE
*The Rogue is a rule-breaker, a joker, a delinquent -- a figure on the fringes who snipes at the people in charge. Play the Rogue if you like the idea of being a troublemaker.*
Troublemaking, lonely, attention-seeking, selfish. The Rogue is an outsider & a miscreant, whatever their background or training might be. If they’re from a Privileged or Military upbringing, they might look like a different kind of delinquent than 1 from an Outlaw or Urban background...but in either case, they’re known as a troublemaker even among their own people. Someone with an Outlaw background might be stereotyped as being a criminal by people from other backgrounds, but a Rogue with an Outlaw background is trouble even for other criminals.
The Rogue became such a scoundrel & rulebreaker out of a need to survive. Something in their circumstances & background threatened their life, perhaps outright, perhaps metaphorically. For some Rogues, they became rulebreakers because they needed food; for others, they became rulebreakers because life threatened to drain them of personality or hope or will. Whatever the case, they didn’t just start causing trouble for the heck of it -- or rather, causing trouble for the heck of it helped them survive in the first place.
**Demeanor Options**: Acerbic, Joking, Cynical, Sly, Extreme, Wild
**History**
• How did you come to feel that the only way to survive was to break the rules?
• Who kept trying to reach a kind hand out towards you, only to be rebuffed?
• Who was ready to do anything to break you of your bad habits?
• What is your favorite possession that you stole, swiped, or otherwise acquired illegitimately?
• Why are you committed to this group or purpose?
**Connections**
•  is waaaaay too uptight, too trapped in themselves; they need to break some rules!
•  is amazing & I hope they like me; maybe they’re worth playing it straight?
**Moment of Balance**
You learned early on that you had to do what you needed to survive, & that sometimes that meant you lost friends. Now, you find a new balance: rule-breaking isn’t something that just drives people away -- it’s something you can use constructively, with your friends! Tell the GM how you lead your companions to break all the rules & accomplish an incredible feat.
**Principles**
*Friendship vs Survival*
The Rogue’s principles represent their struggle with their habits, formed out of a need to survive, & their desire not to drive others away with the same bad habits. 
The Rogue’s principle of *Survival* is their drive & need to selfishly make it through difficulties alive -- but not necessarily well, or triumphantly. They grew whatever defenses & strategies they needed to make it through bad times mostly intact, but their defenses & strategies often left others out in the cold, & tended not to produce constructive results. A Rogue acting on Survival isn’t trying to win a fight; they’re desperately trying to survive it, at any cost. A Rogue with a high Survival is self-centered, but practically impossible to destroy.
The Rogue’s principle of *Friendship*, however, represents their desire to actually form bonds over their desire to simply survive. Surviving at all costs includes the cost of most relationships, & the Rogue is aware of this tragedy. Committing to Friendship means deciding that maybe connections with their companions matter more than just avoiding harm. A Rogue with a high Friendship is willing to turn their hard-won survival skills & strategies to the task of helping their friends.
The Rogue finds a new way to combine these 2 principles in their Moment of Balance. In their Moment of Balance, the Rogue realizes that protecting their friends is a way to survive, too -- that protecting the people they care about protects the Rogue, as well. The Rogue breaks all the rules, but does it to help others, & thereby helps themselves.
**Bad Habits**
You’ve picked up some bad habits over the years. Most other people are pretty set on trying to get you to stop. But maybe you can bring your friends along for the ride... Choose 4 bad habits you indulge:
 casual thievery & pickpocketing
 vandalism or sabotage
 trespassing
 daredevil stunts
 "charming" insults of dangerous people
 cons
 rabble-rousing
 gambling
Any necessary skills or talents related to your bad habits are considered to be part of your background.
When you indulge a bad habit on your own, shift your balance toward Survival, & roll with Survival. On a hit, you pull it off & vent your frustrations; clear fatigue or conditions equal to your Survival (minimum 0). If you have no fatigue or conditions, mark growth. On a 10+, you also gain a windfall, a boon or opportunity -- your bad habits paid off this time. On a miss, you’re caught by someone dangerous or powerful, & they complicate your life.
When you indulge a bad habit with a friend, shift your balance toward Friendship, & roll with Friendship. On a hit, you & your friend pull it off & grow closer; each of you makes the other Inspired. On a 10+, you also obtain some useful resource or information, & become Prepared. On a miss, something goes terribly awry; you can either take the heat yourself, or shift your Balance twice toward Survival & leave your friend in the lurch.
**The Rogue’s Bad Habits & Moves**
The Rogue has picked up some bad habits over the years. These habits were part of the Rogue’s need to survive, but now they tend to cause trouble as much as they help. Whatever 4 bad habits you pick, remember that you have all the skills necessary to be adept at those things, no matter your background & training -- a privileged, military Rogue is still a fantastic thief if they choose “Casual thievery & pickpocketing”.
The Rogue can pursue bad habits to vent, to clear fatigue & conditions... but only if the Rogue pursues their bad habits alone. When you “clear fatigue or conditions equal to your Survival,” you split the total amount of conditions & fatigue between them however you choose. Remember that if you have nothing to clear, you mark growth, but you can’t choose to clear nothing & mark growth if you have any fatigue or conditions marked. On a 10+, the GM decides what your windfall looks like.
If you pursue your bad habits with a friend, however, you can become Inspired, or even Prepared (if you roll a 10+). Remember that becoming Prepared on a 10+ is in addition to becoming Inspired. In either case, make sure you describe what you & your friend are actually doing together -- to do it, you have to do it! You have to actually indulge your bad habits to trigger the move! On a miss, you choose whether you leave your friend in the lurch or take the heat yourself, & then the GM will tell you exactly what happens -- but if you take the heat yourself, you give your friend a chance to get away clean, & if you choose to leave them in the lurch, you escape from consequences...for now.
**Growth Question**
*Did you get a friend to join in or approve of 1 of your bad habits?*
The Rogue’s growth question is all about sharing their bad habits with new friends. If the bad habit becomes a way to bond with others, then the Rogue can grow & learn to change.

THE SUCCESSOR
*The Successor comes from a powerful, tarnished lineage. Play the Successor if you want to struggle against your lineage as it threatens to draw you in.*
Prestigious, redemptive, pigeonholed, rebellious. The Successor comes from a powerful family, group, order, or lineage -- they’re the inheritor of real power, in 1 way or another, & everyone in the group believes the Successor belongs to it. But the lineage of the Successor is mired in corruption, or tragedy, or dark rumors. It’s not an unequivocally noble inheritance; it’s characterized by a tradition of destructive or cruel decisions & practices.
The Successor is a bit like the Icon; this identity has been foisted upon them. But unlike the Icon, this isn’t some specific, honored role that the Successor faces; it has the weight of an entire legacy with its own enemies, allies, responsibilities, & benefits. What’s more, nearly every NPC knows of the lineage, because the lineage holds power over or changed the scope in a significant way. If the scope of the game is the Northern Water Tribe, then the lineage is 1 of the most important families in the entire Northern Water Tribe, a name known to every Waterbender & ice fisher alike. Getting out from under that name, its weight, & its borne assumptions is quite the challenge for the Successor.
**Demeanor Options**: Perky, Intense, By-the-book, Casual, Arrogant, Oblivious
**History**
• Who is the current head of your lineage? How do you love & frustrate each other?
• What close member of your lineage wants to revolutionize it?
• What do you carry that reminds you of the place most associated with your lineage?
• What part of your lineage’s identity is most important & valuable to you as a person?
• Why are you committed to this group or purpose?
**Connections**
•  has major concerns, fears, or grievances with my lineage -- & with me, by proxy.
•  seems free of their past in a way I wish I could let go of mine; hearing them talk about the future feels amazing!
**Moment of Balance**
You may never escape the legacy of your family, but balance allows you to learn from them without defining yourself in their image. You call upon a resource of your family to innovate a new solution to an intractable problem, never forgetting who you are in the face of incredible danger. Tell the GM how you knock down obstacles that seem impossible to overcome & save the day.
**Principles**
*Tradition vs Progress*
The Successor’s split between their desire to uphold the greatness of their lineage & their desire to forge their own path is represented in their 2 principles. 
The Successor’s principle of *Tradition* represents their commitment to the lineage, both its heritage & its practices & power. A Successor with a high Tradition cares about their lineage & seeks to uphold it. A high Tradition Successor may not be happy with the darker elements of their lineage, but they aren’t out-of-hand opposed & disgusted. Instead, they see the value & power of the lineage & the way it has done things & seek to respect & honor their forebears.
The Successor’s *Progress* principle, on the other hand, represents their desire to find new ways, different from the ways of their lineage. They don’t have to be outright disrespectful or disdainful of their lineage, but they certainly aren’t deeply rigid about it or refraining from making changes on the grounds that “this is how it’s always been done”. A Successor with high Progress very often wants to make amends for the worst excesses of their lineage but might also be looking for other non-traditional changes to their lineage.
The Successor finds a way to combine these 2 paths in their Moment of Balance. When they use their Moment of Balance, they both appreciate & value their lineage & everything it has given them, while also finding a new & better way to actually apply that power. They innovate while drawing on their lineage’s resources to solve an unsolvable problem.
**A Tainted Past**
You hail from a powerful, infamous lineage -- 1 with an impressive & terrible reputation. Your lineage has had a massive impact on the world within the scope of your story -- its reach extends over the whole scope, & everyone in the scope knows of it. Choose 1 domain that is the source of your lineage’s power -- the area in which they affected the world -- & another into which they’re now beginning to extend their reach.
 high society
 military command
 arts & entertainment
 land ownership
 organized crime
 spiritual authority
 state politics
 business & industry
 elite academics
 vigilante militias
 media & news
 vital supply chains
*Lineage Resources*: You have access to your family's extensive stores of 2 of the following resources:
 obscure or forbidden knowledge
 introductions & connections
 servants or muscles
 high technology
 cold hard cash
 spiritual artifacts or tomes
Spend resources during the session to establish a boon you had previously asked for or obtained, something that your lineage’s unique position & stores could provide: a vehicle, an invitation, a chest of jade coins, etc.
*Humble Yourself*: When you politely & obediently humble yourself before a powerful member of your lineage, roll with your Tradition. On a hit, you earn some credit; hold 3-resources. On a 7–9, their resources don’t come without strings; you’ll need to promise to fulfill some other obligation of your lineage, or let them shift your balance. On a miss, they’re dissatisfied with your display; they’re cutting you off until you fulfill some task they set to you.
*Raid Your Lineage's Resources*: When you raid your lineage’s resources without their consent or knowledge, mark a condition & roll with your Progress. On a hit, hold 1-resource. On a 7–9, choose 1. On a 10+, choose 2.
• you obtain an additional 1-resource
• you nab your goodies quietly; your lineage is none the wiser
• you steel yourself for what you're doing; avoid marking a condition
On a miss, you’re caught red-handed by a powerful member of your lineage who saw you coming.
**The Successor’s Tainted Past**
The Successor’s lineage is always powerful in at least 1 area & attempting to gain power in another. The area in which your lineage is powerful is their base of strength, what they’re known for throughout the scope of your game, & the way that they exert power & influence at large. The area in which they are extending their reach describes where they focus their efforts to gain influence most, & where they likely find opposition.
The Successor has access to 2 extensive stores of resources from their lineage. Keep in mind that these aren’t meant to be perfectly transferable; having access to cold hard cash doesn’t mean you can easily just spend that cash to gain access to obscure or forbidden knowledge, for example.
You can spend resources, a special Successor-only game currency, to establish useful boons from your lineage. You gain resources when you humble yourself or when you raid your lineage’s resources. In either case, you don’t have to define everything you get at that moment; you can hold your resources & spend them as you need to establish something you might have gotten, asked for, or set up earlier. For example, you can spend 1-resource to have a car when you need it if you had previously humbled yourself to your high-technology lineage.
Humbling yourself does mean you have to go to a powerful member of your lineage; make sure you have someone in mind when you go, as it influences what requests & balance shifts they give you.
When you raid your lineage’s resources, make sure it’s clear where or how you do so, be it by breaking into your family’s safe or heading down to the family factory to fill your pockets. The move covers everything else about the raid; you’re only caught if you roll a miss.
**Growth Question**
*Did you learn something meaningful or important about your lineage, its members, or its effects on the world & others?*
The Successor’s growth question is all about coming to learn more, discover more, & better understand their own lineage. They can grow by learning direct secrets or by learning about the lineage’s effects on the world. Because the Successor’s lineage should be well-known throughout the scope of your game, it shouldn’t be hard to find out something about them nearly anywhere the Successor goes.

EARNING GROWTH
Growth is a generalized kind of learning, expanding your character’s mind, your experiences, & your skillset. Growth isn’t about training hard, mastering some complicated new technique or ability; growth is about having your ideas challenged & coming to understand yourself & the world better.
For the most part, PCs earn growth through answering growth questions at the end of each session. There are 3 growth questions that the group always discusses together but answers individually, & then every character has a growth question from their own playbook that they also answer. These questions help sum up the session & point the players toward actions in-line with their playbooks.
Sometimes, PCs might earn growth through other means, often playbook moves or by resisting shifting their balance (see page 140), but those means always call out the circumstances in which the character earns growth. While the growth questions at the end of each session point toward the lessons your companions have learned, growth you earn during a session usually points toward important experiences you’ve had, like standing up for yourself in the face of pressure!
When you “mark growth” or “earn growth,” you mark the next box on your growth track of 4 growth boxes. Once all 4 are marked, you earn a growth advancement, improving your stats, learning new moves, unlocking your Moment of Balance, or shifting your balance.

**The Growth Move**
At the end of each session, your whole group determines how much growth you’ve each earned through the baseline growth move, answering questions & marking 1 growth for each yes answered:
At the end of each session, each player answers the following questions:
• Did you learn something challenging, exciting, or complicated about the world?
• Did you stop a dangerous threat or solve a community problem?
• Did you guide a character towards balance or end the session at your center?
Each player also answers their playbook’s unique personal growth question. For each “yes,” mark growth. When you have marked 4 growth, you take a growth advancement.

**What Ends A Session?**
The next few sections cover these questions -- & the growth advancements -- in greater detail, but 1 oft overlooked element of the growth move is how often your group makes the move! Most groups treat the “end of session” as the end of a full session of your campaign, but there’s nothing wrong with running shorter sessions (two hours) or answering the growth questions midway through a session if you’ve reached an important stopping point, like the end of an adventure.
The more often your group evaluates growth, the more growth you’re going to earn. Even if you don’t answer yes to every question every time, you’ll still find your character advancing much faster when you check for growth more regularly. Some groups prefer a more slow & steady pace -- only checking for growth at the end of a long session -- but a faster pace won’t break anything!
Ultimately, the growth move should be a reminder that your story is your own, built by your group & featuring your characters. If you feel like you haven’t had a chance to stop a dangerous threat, you can tell your GM you’d like to see more dangerous threats appear on screen. & if you’d like your characters to advance more quickly, you can check for growth more often.

**Growth Questions**
When answering the questions, the player answers on behalf of their character, but at an out-of-character level, looking at the story as a whole. The answers here can reflect the way their PC feels, but can also contrast with their feelings -- a character might refuse to acknowledge that they learned how they needed their friends during a fight, but the player can usually still recognize that their PC learned that lesson.
Ultimately every answer is a conversation, & if the GM & the player or even other players disagree about the answer, then they should keep talking! Growth questions are about the characters, what they did, what they learned, what they felt, but also about getting all the players on the same page regarding the fiction, what happened, & at least 1 view of the events of the session. They’re a good chance to collectively review the session & talk about how the players feel, & to come to a shared understanding to move forward.
It’s important that the GM & the players agree on the answers to these questions. If anybody honestly disagrees with an answer, then the conversation continues until those players can reach a shared understanding. The GM can make the final call if absolutely necessary, but the GM should give the benefit of the doubt to what the player says. If a player feels that they guided someone toward balance, for example, then the GM should make an attempt to look at the situation through the player’s perspective.
Here are the base questions in greater detail:

***Did you learn something challenging, exciting, or complicated about the world?***
This question is all about learning interesting things! As long as a PC learned something challenging, or something exciting, or something complicated -- not necessarily all 3 -- their answer to this question is a yes. Unsurprisingly, you will probably answer yes to this question nearly every session; the whole point of the game is to have fun & interesting adventures!
“Challenging, exciting, or complicated” is a broad set of ideas designed to aim players at thinking about whether or not their characters learned something that expands their view of the world. If a PC “learned” something completely in-line with their expectations or beliefs...they didn’t really learn anything, did they? Push past the ordinary experiences of day-to-day adventuring if you want to earn a growth from this question.
“About the world” also means that the scope of what the character learned can be pretty varied. Learning that a loved 1 betrayed them is a kind of “learning about the world,” as much as learning that not all Fire Nation citizens are evil is a kind of “learning about the world.” You can also learn more about your own place in the world; discovering that your character wasn’t willing to join a rebellion against an unjust ruler because they feared what the uprising would cost ordinary people is a good hint that you learned something new about your character & their values & goals.

***Did you stop a dangerous threat or solve a community problem?***
This question is all about solving problems! As long as a PC helped stop a dangerous threat or solved a community problem -- not necessarily both -- the answer to this question is a yes.
“Stop a dangerous threat” means exactly what it says. Thanks to your efforts, some danger was abated. A dangerous threat doesn’t have to be a person; it could be an avalanche, a volcano, a tsunami, etc. & “dangerous threat” only means that it’s dangerous to someone; that someone could be the PC, or it could be innocent townsfolk, or it could be the animals of the forest. “Stopping” the threat doesn’t have to be permanent either. The answer is still yes as long as the danger is abated for now.
“Solve a community problem” means that you helped some community of people & solved a problem for or with them. This doesn’t always have to deal with a threat! If the community is divided over the issue of whether or not to invite Earthen Fire Industries to open up a nearby factory, then that might not really be a “dangerous threat,” but it’s definitely a “community problem.”

***Did you guide a character towards balance or end the session at your center?***
This question is all about balance! As long as the PC guided another character toward balance or ended the session with their balance at their own center -- not necessarily both -- the answer to this question is a yes.
“Guide a character towards balance” requires conversation & shared understanding, because it partially depends upon the character you guided. If they felt your guidance actually misled them, pushed them away from balance, then the answer might be no. However, even if they ignored your guidance, the answer might still be yes. “Balance” here can mean many things, ranging from trying to help a fellow PC push their balance to their own center, to trying to help an NPC overcome negative emotions that are hurting them & to rebalance themselves, to steering someone away from a path of danger & conflict & toward balance.
You “end the session at your center” when, at the end of the session, your balance & your center share the same point on the track. As long as that’s true, the answer to this question is yes!

**Playbook Growth Questions**
Every player character then has their own specific question keyed to the nature of growth for that playbook. Answer these questions in the same way as the above, breaking them down & thinking about their terms, making sure that the table understands the answer collectively. Often, reviewing the playbook growth questions together is a good way to quickly understand the tensions & arc of each character, as well as where they are on their current journey.
Not all playbook growth questions work the same! Some are very focused, while others are broad & open to interpretation. Don’t worry if you find yourself hitting your playbook’s growth question less often than other players, but try to keep your playbook growth question in mind every session!

**Growth Advancements**
When your character has marked all 4 boxes of their growth track, you clear all 4 boxes & earn a growth advancement! The growth advancement comes into play immediately, providing your PC with its benefits as soon as you earn it. Usually this happens at the end of the session, functionally between sessions, but even if it happens during play, the PC immediately gets access to the advancement.
If you aren’t sure exactly what to take, you don’t need to decide immediately, but you should take the advancement by the end of the next session at the absolute latest. Your character should evolve naturally over time instead of banking 3 or 4 advancements to be used all at once!
The growth advancements are listed on every playbook, along with boxes. Each time you take a growth advancement, mark 1 of those boxes; if there are no empty boxes, you can’t take that advancement anymore. The 1 exception is “Raising a stat by +1,” but you may only raise any stat to a maximum of +2 total through standard growth advancements. (Some moves from some playbooks let you raise a stat to +3 total.)
This does mean eventually your character won’t be able to continue to earn growth advancements -- & that’s okay! That signals they have already grown a great deal, & their story is likely coming to a close for Avatar Legends: The Roleplaying Game.

**Growth Advancements**:
• Take a new move from your playbook 
• Take a new move from another playbook 
• Raise a stat by +1 (maximum of +2 in any given stat)
• Shift your center 1 step 
• Unlock your Moment of Balance 

**Take a new move from your playbook or another playbook**
These advancements let you take new moves from the Moves section of your or other playbooks. You can only take 2 more moves from your own playbook & 2 more moves from other playbooks. The 2 you take from other playbooks can come from any playbooks you choose -- they don’t have to be the same1.
Taking a move from a playbook never allows you to take that playbook’s special feature. The only way to get access to a playbook’s feature is to switch to that playbook (see page 218)!

**Raise a stat by +1**
These advancements allow you to raise 1 of your stats -- Creativity, Focus, Harmony, or Passion -- by 1, to a maximum of +2. You can take this advancement many times, eventually raising every stat to +2 -- but that’ll take some time!
If you want to raise a stat to +3, certain playbook moves allow you to raise a stat to +3 -- check out The Adamant, The Guardian, The Icon, The Pillar, & The Successor playbooks for those moves.

**Shift your center 1 step**
When you take this advancement, you can immediately shift your center 1 step, any way you like! Remember that your center is your default, where your balance resets to when time passes. If your center ever goes past +3, then it’s time to retire or change your character. You could use this advancement to shift your center past +3 if you wanted, functionally bringing the story of your character (at least as this particular playbook) to a close -- see more on page 219.

**Unlock your Moment of Balance**
When you take this advancement, you gain the ability to use your Moment of Balance! Every playbook has its own Moment of Balance, a description of the way that playbook reaches a state of powerful, true balance, combining its principles into a greater whole. You can only use that Moment of Balance when you have unlocked it through this advancement & your balance is at your center during play. If your balance is off your center, you can’t use your Moment of Balance even if you have unlocked it!
After you’ve used your Moment of Balance, you can still take this advancement a second time to unlock it again, allowing you to use it once more. You can read more about Moments of Balance on page 121.

ADVANCED TECHNIQUES
In addition to growth advancements, every PC in Avatar Legends: The Roleplaying Game can improve themselves in another way -- by learning & mastering new advanced techniques. Learning advanced techniques represents a character’s skills growing, as they become capable of performing new & impressive feats consistently within combat & more powerful & dynamic uses of their training in general.
All player characters start play with all 9 basic techniques mastered. In fact, every fighter in this game has mastered all 9 basic techniques, based on their training. Any NPC who doesn’t have all 9 basic techniques mastered is not a trained fighter at the level of most in Avatar Legends: The Roleplaying Game, but might be a student or an ordinary citizen who doesn’t have much cause to practice their bending in combat.
Advanced techniques, on the other hand, are more sophisticated, more complicated, & often more powerful than basic techniques. They represent complex, specific sequences of movements & corresponding states of mind & will. Any Firebender can conjure a fire, & likely blast a fireball; but only some Firebenders are trained in creating the dreaded fire pinwheel!

**Learning Techniques**
When a PC learns techniques in Avatar Legends: The Roleplaying Game, they always learn advanced techniques. A player character first gains an advanced technique at learned level, then improves it to practiced level, & finally to mastered level:
• ***Learned techniques***: the PC has learned the basics & can replicate this technique some of the time. They still need practice & additional understanding to really master this.
• ***Practiced techniques***: the PC has learned & successfully applied the technique in a stressful combat situation. They have a greater ability to call upon it with ease & efficacy, but have yet to fully master it; they still can’t call upon the technique at will.
• ***Mastered techniques***: the PC has gained full control & can perform the technique at will, consistently, every time, without question, just like the basic techniques. To master a technique, the PC must fulfill a mastery condition, some special task set to them by their teacher (often when the character first learns the technique, but sometimes set much later).

Mastering a new technique is often an important part of your character’s journey; it might prompt them to seek out a teacher & contend with new & difficult challenges. For example, Sokka’s desire to master the sword led him to study under Piandao, a master swordsman from the Fire Nation who challenged the young Sokka to grow considerably in both his sword training & his strategic thinking. Training allows your character to be guided in this journey, mastering new techniques under the eyes of a watchful teacher & mentor.

**Types of Advanced Techniques**
The full list of advanced techniques can be found in Appendix A: Techniques. Within that broader list of techniques, there are a few different types:

**Universal Techniques**
Any technique that can be learned by all characters, regardless of training, is a universal technique. These techniques tend to focus on broad strategies during a combat exchange, such as charging an opponent or protecting an ally. All trainings that are not universal are keyed to a specific training, such as waterbending techniques or technology techniques -- they can only be learned by a character with that particular training.
NPCs without highly distinctive fighting styles usually use universal techniques, but remember that they always make use of their training -- an Earthbender who uses a universal technique in a combat exchange is still using earthbending.

**Group Techniques**
Some techniques can only appear when used by groups of NPCs (page 237); these are group techniques. PCs can never learn group techniques -- even if they fight as a group, each individual PC still retains their ability to act independently & choose their own techniques -- so these techniques are only for the GM to use when designing group NPCs.
You can expect virtually all group NPCs to feature at least 1 group technique. These techniques are specifically created to help the GM represent a group fighting together, swarming their opponents to try to get the upper hand or scattering & withdrawing to avoid the PCs’ blows.

**Rare Techniques**
Techniques that are particularly powerful & potent are often rare techniques, closely guarded secrets that masters only share with their most trusted students. Such techniques are notably more powerful than other techniques; learning them often requires a student to build a relationship with the master & mastering them often requires considerably more work.
NPCs who have mastered rare techniques are, well, rare. But they are also the only NPCs who can serve as teachers for these potent abilities.

**Specialized Bending Techniques**
Finally, some specialized bending techniques require characters to have mastered specialized forms of bending -- like healing or lightningbending -- in order to learn them. Each of these techniques is marked with the specialized bending form, such as “lavabending” or “metalbending.” You can read more about learning & mastering specialized bending forms on page 216.
In early eras, many forms of specialized bending are virtually non-existant, but later eras feature many characters who have mastered metalbending, lightningbending, lavabending, & more. While NPCs who have mastered these techniques are always potent foes, you can expect their rarity to be directly related to the era you’ve chosen for your game.

**Training & Techniques**
When you want to learn a new technique, first you need some way to do so. Some playbooks have special ways to learn techniques (like the Prodigy), but most need a teacher, someone who has already mastered the technique & is willing & capable of teaching it. Player characters can’t, in general, teach each other techniques, even if they’ve mastered them; they are still finding themselves & seeking balance, so they aren’t ready to be teachers yet. They have to find teachers out in the world, be they local craftspeople who have mastered some specific use of firebending, or the greatest swordswoman in the entire world.
Remember that you can only learn techniques appropriate for your own training, by default. Some playbooks have ways to get around this, but most Firebenders can only learn techniques that are either universal or specific to firebending, for example. It doesn’t help a Firebender to learn how to create walls of ice!
Your teacher must have mastered the technique they’re teaching you. Mechanically, this means that you aren’t going to be taught by a student, someone who’s still learning -- they’re liable to impart the wrong lessons. But within the game, masters abound! The local Waterbender angler likely has mastered techniques to aid in her day-to-day job, but those techniques are still valuable to learn & quite possibly effective in a fight -- so she’d be a great master!
When you find a teacher who knows the technique & agrees to teach you, then you can use the following move.

**Training Move**
When you spend time with a teacher learning & training in a new technique, roll with modifiers from the following questions:
• Is your balance in line with your center or are you free of conditions? If yes, take +1.
• Do you & your teacher share at least 1 background? If yes, take +1.
• Does your teacher agree with your reasons for training & learning? If no, take -1.
• Is the technique easy to grasp based on your current training, experience, & skills? If no, take -1.

On a hit, you learn the technique, & your master shifts your balance. On a 10+, you learn it with ease, & it takes as little time as possible. On a 7–9, it either takes more time than normal, or you must mark 2 conditions. On a miss, you can’t learn the technique yet because you need another lesson before you can grasp its full use. Your master will tell you what additional task you must undertake to put yourself into the correct state of mind; do it, & you learn the technique.

**Basic Elements of the Training Move**
“Spend time with a teacher learning & training in a new technique” means that you must both have a teacher, & you must have time. You can’t learn a technique in the middle of combat (without special moves). The amount of time may vary, especially based on the results of the move, but a good rule of thumb is to expect at least half a day, if not more. Furthermore, you need to have the teacher’s attention for a significant portion of that time; training is more than just a quick lesson & a day of practice on your own.
When you roll, you don’t add 1 of your stats. Instead, you answer the 4 provided questions. 2 of them provide a +1 if you answer “yes,” & 2 of them impose a -1 if you answer “no.” Total up the balance of these questions & roll with that total, taking into account all of the answers.
“Is your balance in line with your center or are you free of conditions” means that you learn better when you’re stable, in control of yourself, in balance. The “or” in the question means that if you satisfy either question, you get the +1. So, if your balance is in line with your center you get a +1, or if you have no conditions marked you get a +1.
“Do you & your teacher share at least 1 background” means that you have a slightly easier time learning from a teacher with whom you share something in common. You aren’t penalized for being different, but the similarity can smooth the way forward -- so if you answer yes to this question, you get a +1 on the move.
“Does your teacher agree with your reasons for training & learning” means your teacher both understands why you want to train -- the real reason, not any lies or half-truths you might have tried to use on them -- & approves. In rare circumstances, your teacher might still understand your reasons for training without you explaining. You might even have lied to your teacher, only for them to see through your lies! But the vast majority of the time, if you’ve obscured your reasons, your teacher won’t know the real reasons & thus can’t agree with them. When your teacher doesn’t agree with your reasons for learning, they have a harder time teaching you -- there’s a fundamental divide between you that makes the training more difficult. So, when the answer to this question is no, you take a -1 on the move.
“Is the technique easy to grasp based on your current training, experience, & skills?” means that difficult, complicated, or strange techniques are harder to learn. More powerful techniques are generally more complicated to grasp. Similarly, rare techniques may be even more complicated to grasp, & techniques tied to specialized forms of bending that the PC hasn’t learned yet -- metalbending techniques, bloodbending techniques, combustionbending techniques -- are the hardest. (For more on specialized bending, see page 216.) The GM is the final arbiter of whether the technique is easy to grasp or not but should focus on the extent of the PC’s skills & all the techniques they’ve learned so far. In general, if there is any doubt about whether the technique should be within the PC’s grasp, then the answer to this question is “no”, & would impose a -1 on the roll.

**Results of the Training Move**
“On a hit, you learn the technique & your master shifts your balance” means that you take the technique at learned level, & your master can shift your balance in whichever direction they choose -- taking up their lessons does shift your balance at least a bit.
“On a 7–9, it either takes more time than normal, or you must mark 2 conditions” gives you a hard choice. If you mark 2 conditions, you come out of the training emotionally frustrated or thrown, but successful. If you take more time than normal, however, you’re handing the GM a golden opportunity to make a GM move, to say that something happens while you’re busy training that you can’t affect, stop, or interfere with. It might leave you out of a fight that embroils your fellow companions; it might be something terrible happening to the local town. Be prepared!
“On a miss, you can’t learn the technique yet because you need another lesson before you can grasp its full use” means exactly that -- you can’t complete your training right here, right now, without additional effort. “Your master will tell you what additional task you must undertake to put yourself into the correct state of mind; do it, & you learn the technique” means that your master will give you some other duty or task. That task takes you on a journey, changing your mind & leading you to new understanding, but allowing you to actually learn the technique in full. As soon as you complete the task, you get the technique at learned level, but the GM is the arbiter of whether or not the task is complete.
When the GM assigns you a task, it relates in some way to the nature of the technique, & the lessons the teacher might have to teach about the world, people, & balance. It doesn’t have to be as complicated as a mastery condition (see below) -- it’s usually something you can do within a session -- but that framework can be useful for thinking about appropriate tasks.

**Example Tasks**:
• Apologize to another player character, honestly & truly, for some wrongdoing
• Work to aid, help, or save an NPC who desperately needs it
• Journey to a nearby location of spiritual or historical prominence, & study it or meditate on it
• Obtain a local resource & deliver it to the teacher or another NPC
• Agree with the teacher, honestly, about some rule or restriction on future action

**Improving Techniques**
After you have learned a technique -- marking it on your playbook at learned level -- you can now use it in combat exchanges, but only if you roll a 10+ on the stance move (page 148) & mark an additional fatigue. Those are some high bars! The good news, however, is that you can improve your control & ability to use the technique. You can take your learned technique & make it practiced; & you can take your practiced technique & master it.
But improving techniques requires you to do some work on your own! While learning a technique requires you to find a teacher willing to train you, advancing your knowledge further requires you to go beyond direct instruction, practicing the technique during combat exchanges & (eventually) working to understand the technique at a new level through the mastery conditions your teacher sets for you.

**Going from Learned to Practiced**
To take your technique from learned level to practiced level, you have to use it once -- just once! -- in combat. That means rolling a 10+ on the stance move, & paying the additional cost of 1-fatigue (beyond any cost the technique itself might impose). But as soon as you’ve done that once, the technique is at practiced level. That means you’ve used it & you can call on it immediately, even in the very next combat exchange -- not with the same simple ease as a mastered technique, but more easily than at learned. A practiced technique can be used when you roll a 10+ on the stance move, without paying any additional cost.

**Going from Practiced to Mastered**
To take your technique from practiced level to mastered level, you have to overcome a higher bar. You have to fulfill a mastery condition, as set to you by your teacher. A mastery condition is a special task to teach you a further lesson, to help you shift your mind & balance to a place where you can gain total control & mastery over the particular technique you’re focused on.
To learn what your mastery condition must be for the technique, you must have a teacher -- you have to have someone to guide you. Your mastery condition is also specifically yours. Every mastery condition is suited to the technique, the teacher, & the student. The condition represents what the teacher thinks the student must learn.
Most of the time, you can get a mastery condition as soon as you learn the technique. Usually, the GM assigns you just such a mastery condition after you have successfully taken the technique at learned level. But you can also get the mastery condition later, especially from more crotchety, ornery teachers who prefer you master the basics (i.e. go from learned to practiced level) before they even tell you the mastery condition. No matter what, however, a teacher, specifically, sets the mastery condition -- & a different teacher might set a different mastery condition.
Setting a mastery condition requires the GM to think about the PC, the teacher, & what the teacher might want the character to learn, especially in context of this particular technique. A technique about overwhelming, defeating power taught by a quiet, unassuming monk to a brash, aggressive Hammer might lead the teacher to ask the Hammer to submit, to surrender to a dangerous foe -- the lesson of defeat is crucial for the student to understand how to use that force on a foe. A technique about evasive action taught by a master thief to a boisterous, fun-loving Icon might lead the teacher to ask the Icon to purposefully make others angry with them, & then to escape from those dangerous situations -- the lesson of ever-more-difficult, ever-more-dangerous evasion pushing the student to understand how to get away from trouble.
GMs should think about the following when setting a mastery condition:
• What are the PC’s principles, & how does the teacher see them? If the teacher sees the character as too far 1 way or the other on the balance track, the teacher could set them a mastery condition to push the other way.
• What does the player character care about? If the teacher thinks the character cares too much about the wrong thing, or too little about the right thing, the teacher can set them a mastery condition that pushes them to change their priorities.
• What is the PC’s personality like? If the character is too much of 1 thing (too aggressive, too quiet, too afraid, too serious), the teacher might set them a mastery condition that pushes them to act differently, to feel differently.
Ultimately, nearly any task can be a good mastery condition, just so long as it’s interesting & leads to fun new stories; it relates to the PC specifically, connecting to their issues & sources of drama; & it’s a challenge to accomplish, but certainly not impossible.

**Example Mastery Conditions**:
• Defeat a specific foe in combat -- useful for when the player character would otherwise run from that foe or has difficulty standing up for themselves. Example: Defeat the leader of the Red Ribbon Bandits, who destroyed your home.
• Surrender -- useful for when the PC is bold or overly brave & needs to learn a lesson in humility. Add “to a specific foe” to push them to a particular enemy they only ever want to fight. Example: Surrender to the Chief of Police of Republic City & face them with head held high.
• Lose your balance -- useful for an overly careful player character, who never loses their balance, whose center has not shifted over many sessions of play. Add “in a specific situation” to make it more directed. Example: Lose your balance in an argument with a powerful figure.
• Be taken out -- useful for when the PC always deals with their conditions before they can threaten to overwhelm them, when they need to learn not to run from their feelings. Add “in a specific situation” to make it more directed. Example: Be taken out outside of combat.
• Seek a specific mystical or ancient location -- useful for when the overall group of companions travels quite a bit, & when the technique is strange or draws on lost wisdom. Example: Seek the Sun Warriors in their hidden city & learn from them.
• Return an important artifact to its proper place -- useful for when the player character doesn’t attach to places or the people in them, & needs to learn a lesson about preservation & protection. Example: Return the spirit tome to its place of prominence in the Eastern Air Temple.
• Find & listen to an opposing teacher -- useful for when the teacher presents a highly polarized view of the world, & the PC needs to learn the lessons at the opposing end of the spectrum. Example: Find the only other student of the same teacher & let them complete your training.
• Build a structure of spiritual or local import -- useful for when the player character is much more of a fighter or a destroyer, or even an evader who tends to run from problems, than a builder who constructs. Add “with/without using particular tools” to make it more poignant or challenging. Example: Construct defenses around the whole of the village without your bending.
• Destroy a dangerous or corrupt structure -- useful for when the PC is more prone to careful, comforting, pleasant, harmonious solutions, & refuses to solve problems, even intractable ones, by bowling them over. Example: Destroy the local polluting factory.
• Tell a specific person a specific, difficult truth -- useful for when the player character’s issues have a lot to do with making decisions, or trying to hide things about themselves. Example: Admit to your other teachers that you, an Icon, don’t want to fulfill your Role.
• Use the technique in an exchange in a particular way -- useful for when the player character is reluctant to make use of an advanced technique or when the technique is particularly powerful or focused. Example: Defeat an opponent using this technique as the final blow.

**Lessons From Other Trainings**
In general, all advanced techniques -- except universal techniques -- are tied to a particular training like Airbending or Weapons, & can only be learned by a character who possesses that training. Characters who have 2 trainings, such as 1 who took the Successor’s Worldly Knowledge move, can learn techniques from each training. Learning techniques without the appropriate training requires a specific move or feature like the Prodigy’s An Open Mind move that allows you to adapt the specific techniques of a different training to your own.
If you want to learn a specific technique outside your training, it’s possible to work with your GM to develop a technique for your training that works in a similar way. For example, you might convert Water Whip (page 282) to Fire Whip, using the technique’s mechanics to represent a quick burst of fire similar to a Waterbender’s tendril of water.
