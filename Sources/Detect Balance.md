4 = astral knowledge (raw unfiltered versatility; valued slightly higher than a skill Prof of choice because changes/LongRest; tool Prof is a ribbon)

Grung
-2 = 25ft walking speed

3 = common resistance (poison)

Harengon
2 = skill Prof (perception)

0 = unarmed strike deals different physical damage (piercing)
1 = unarmed strike 1d6+STR

1 = labyrinthine recall

Orc
6 = adrenaline rush (free bit of movement, & some HP)
1 = powerful build
6 = relentless endurance (stay standing 1/LongRest; situational as it's useless vs hordes. Multiattack foes waste another attack on you)
