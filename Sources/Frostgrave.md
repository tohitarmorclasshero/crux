## Chapter 1: Wizards & Warbands

#### The Table
Once you have your miniatures & dice ready to go, you are going to need a table to play on. Games of Frostgrave are normally played on square tables with sides about 3ft long. In games with more than 2 players, you may want to consider increasing the table size, up to 4x4ft, to give everyone more room to maneuver. If large tables are hard to come by, as they're in my house, you can play games of Frostgrave on smaller tables. A 2x2ft table is probably the minimum you will need to play a game. Smaller tables tend to make for quicker,  bloodier games, but that doesn't mean they're less fun!

#### Terrain
The Frozen City is a twisting maze of ruins & rubble &, to represent these close confines, the table should be filled with terrain. In a perfect world, we would all have vast terrain collections containing numerous ruined buildings, broken walls, & the like, all covered with frost & snow. However, such collections are neither common nor necessary. So long as there is a lot of 'stuff' on the table for figs to hide behind, clamber over, & fight upon, the specific look of the terrain is not important. If you are just starting out in the hobby, you might consider just buying a set of blocks. These blocks can then be used to create all kinds of different table set-ups. You can even paint them grey if you want them to look more like the ruins of stone walls. Don't worry, once you are playing the game, your imagination will 'fill in the gaps', & turn any set-up into another blasted corner of ancient Felstad!

#### Creating A Wizard
Before you can play Frostgrave, you must create a wizard. The wizard represents you on the tabletop & is by far your most important miniature. All your other figs are really just there in support of the wizard.

To create a wizard, you will want to have a copy of the Wizard Sheet from the back of the book. This sheet has spaces for all the important information about your wizard (and their warband) that you will need during the game.

The first decision when creating a wizard is a name. Wizards often have strange-sounding names, so pretty much anything is appropriate. Picking the right name can help set the tone or provide inspiration for the rest of the wizard creation process. It has no mechanical impact, however, so you may hold off on picking a name until the rest of the creation process is completed if you prefer. Be sure to give your wizard a name before they venture into the Frozen City, though!

The next step is to select your wizard type. There are ten different types of wizard, each representing 1 of the ten schools of magic. Each school has its own strengths & weaknesses, & your decision should be based on what kind of magic most appeals to you. If you want a powerful wizard who throws balls of fire & can call down lightning, you'll probably want to play an Elementalist. If you prefer to use trickery & misdirection to win your battles, you might consider playing an Illusionist.

Listed below are the ten different types of wizard, along with a brief description of their abilities, their typical behavior, & their normal mode of dress. These are all generalizations, & it is perfectly acceptable to have a wizard who acts or dresses contrary to the norm.

Below each description is a table showing the relationship of that school of magic to the other nine schools. Each school is aligned with 3 others, neutral towards 5 & directly opposed to 1. The further away a school is from their own, the harder it is for a wizard to cast spells from it, & the numbers in the table identify the penalty incurred during such an attempt.

For simplicity, the same word is used for both the type of wizard & their school of magic. Technically, a Necromancer's school of magic is 'Necromancy', but players are free to use either term.

**Choosing Spells**  
On the Wizard Sheet is a complete list of spells, organized by the school of magic. Explanations of these spells can be found in Chapter 4: Spells (page 108). All new wizards begin knowing eight spells which can be selected from the list, with the following limitations:

• 3 spells must come from the wizard's own school of magic.  
• 1 spell must come from each of the 3 aligned schools of magic.  
• The final 2 spells can be selected from any of the 5 neutral schools, but each must come from a different school.

So, all starting wizards should have 3 spells from their own school & 1 each from 5 other schools. A starting wizard may never have a spell from their opposing school, though these can be learned later.

When a spell is selected, write in its casting number in the space next to it on the Wizard Sheet. For starting wizards, this number will be the same as the base casting number listed in the spell's description in Chapter 4 plus the penalty if a spell is from outside of the wizard's school. For example, an Elementalist spell being attempted by a Soothsayer would have a casting number equal to the spell's base casting number +4 (as the Elementalist school is neutral to the Soothsayer).

As they participate in scenarios, wizards may learn more spells & improve the casting number of spells they know. This is explained in Chapter 3: The Campaign.

**The Stat-Line**  
In Frostgrave, every fig -- wizard, soldier or creature -- has a stat-line, which determines its effectiveness in the game. There are 6 stats, explained below:

• **Move (M)**: the speed of a fig. The higher its Move, the further it can move each turn.  
• **Fight (F)**: the fig's ability in hand-to-hand combat, & its ability to avoid missile fire.  
• **Shoot (S)**: the fig's ability with missile weapons such as bows & crossbows. It does not influence spells which generate shooting attacks.  
• **Armor (A)**: how much physical protection a fig is wearing, including armor, shields, & magic protection. It also includes any natural armor a creature may possess.  
• **Will (W)**: the fig's determination, courage, & ability to resist spells.  
• **Health (H)**: the physical toughness of a fig & how much damage can be endured before it is badly wounded or killed.

Each stat has a number associated with it. Put simply, the higher the number, the better. The specific meaning of each number will be explained later. For now, it is only important to know that every wizard starts the game with the same stat-line. Again, wizards will have opportunities to improve their stat-lines later, as they gain more experience in the ruins of Frostgrave.

Starting Wizard
| Move | Fight | Shoot | Armor | Will | Health |
| ---- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ---- | ------ |
| 6    | +2    | +0    | 10    | +4   | 14     |

#### Split Stats
In some circumstances, it will be necessary to record 2 different values for 1 stat. This is called a split stat & will be indicated as '+2/+3'. In these cases, the first number is always the fig's actual stat, & the second number is its effective stat in the current circumstances. Split stats usually occur when a fig is using a magic item, under the effects of a magic spell, or suffering from some form of injury. All these instances will be fully explained

#### Items
All wizards, apprentices, & soldiers in Frostgrave have at least 1 slot for carrying items. Wizards have 5 slots, apprentices have 4, & soldiers have 1. For soldiers, this single item slot is in addition to whatever equipment they receive as standard (listed in their stat-lines).

A starting wizard may choose their items from the 'General Arms & Armor List', except that they may not wear any type of armor or carry shields as these interfere with spellcasting. In a campaign, wizards can change their items after each game, so if they find a magic staff or an interesting potion, they can carry them in the next game.

And that's essentially it for creating a wizard. They're now ready to go. That said, it's a foolish wizard who ventures into the ruins alone. In the next section, you will learn how to assemble a warband of followers to take with you on your quest for magic treasure.

#### Assembling A Warband
Every starting wizard begins the game with 400 gold crowns (gc) which they can use to hire followers to aid their treasure hunts. Generally, a warband consists of a max of ten figs: a wizard, an apprentice, & eight soldiers, although there are a few rules that allow for additional warband members.

#### The Apprentice
It costs 100gc for a newly created wizard to hire an apprentice. While it is not strictly necessary for a wizard to have an apprentice, it would be both unusual & probably unwise to go without. Apprentices offer a huge degree of tactical flexibility & are the only way to have a second caster in the warband. Also note, not having an apprentice does not increase the number of soldiers a wizard is allowed to have in their warband.

#### Apprentice Stats
Apprentices are a special case when it comes to their stat-line. Instead of having a fixed stat-line, as do other characters, an apprentice generates their stat-line as a function of the wizard's stat-line. Essentially, the apprentice is learning their trade from the wizard -- if the wizard is good at something, the apprentice will be too. As the wizard gets better, so too will the apprentice.

To determine your apprentice's stat-line, subtract 2 from your wizard's Fight, Will, & Health stats. An apprentice's stat-line will always be based on the wizard's actual stat (the first number in any split stat) & never on their current effective stat.

Determining the Apprentice Stat-Line
| M      | F        | S      | A   | W        | H        |
| ------ | -------- | ------ | --- | -------- | -------- |
| Wiz | Wiz-2 | Wiz | 10  | Wiz-2 | Wiz-2 |

So, a starting apprentice will have the following stat-line.

Starting Apprentice
| M   | F   | S   | A   | W   | H   |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 6   | +0  | +0  | 10  | +2  | 12  |

#### Apprentice Items
Apprentices have 4 item slots and, like wizards, may choose their starting items from the 'General Arms & Armor List'. Apprentices may not wear any armor or carry a shield.

#### Apprentice Spells
As apprentices are learning their magic from their wizard, it should come as no surprise that they know the same spells. Thus, it is only necessary to keep track of 1 set of spells. However, because the apprentice is still learning & because secretive wizards rarely share all the information in their mystical libraries, even with their own apprentices, these young casters are less proficient at casting the spells. In game terms, apprentices use the same casting numbers as their wizard, but with a -2 penalty to every roll to cast a spell.

#### The Soldiers
With the rediscovery of Frostgrave, several 'boom towns' have formed around the outskirts of the city. These rough, lawless places teem with men & women hoping to join a wizard & find riches in the ruins. While many of these individuals have no actual combat training, they're all generally referred to as 'soldiers', at least by wizards, who rarely have much interest in the martial arts. Due to the sheer number of these fortune seekers, wizards can generally recruit them into their warband with just a promise of future treasure or maybe a small retainer.

Soldiers that do possess high levels of training or specific skills are called 'specialist soldiers'. These soldiers require larger retainers & positions of authority within a warband.

Each wizard may recruit up to eight soldiers to join their warband, of which a max of 4 can be specialists. To recruit a soldier, the wizard simply pays the retainer cost given on the tables below. A few soldiers are 'free', meaning that no retainer is necessary to recruit them. Thus, a wizard should always be able to field a full warband for a game, even if it isn't composed of soldiers of the highest quality.

Each soldier has fixed stats, as listed in the Soldier Tables below. Unlike wizards & apprentices, a soldier's stats will never increase except through magic or the use of magic items.

Each soldier also has a standard set of equipment, as listed in the 'Notes' column on the Soldier Tables. Soldiers may not be given additional items from the 'General Arms & Armor List'. Should a soldier ever lose 1 of these standard items in the course of their adventures, they will receive a free replacement at the end of the game. Each soldier also has 1 item slot that they can use to carry a potion, magic weapon, or magic item. A soldier may carry a magic weapon or wear magic armor if it is the same type as a weapon or armor listed in their notes (e.g. a thief is equipped with a dagger as standard, so could only use a magic dagger; they could not use a magic hand weapon, nor could they wear magic armor). In this case, the magic weapon or armor both replaces their mundane version & fills their 1 item slot.

The stats given for each soldier incorporate any bonuses or penalties to their Move or Armor stats provided by the items listed in their notes.  

The Wizard Sheet contains space to list all your soldiers & their stats. You can even give them all names if you wish (but it is best not to get too attached to them...).

| Marksman        | 5   | +2  | +2  | 12  | +1  | 12  | 125  | Crossbow, Quiver, Hand weapon, Armor(H) |

**War Hounds**  
As animals, war hounds cannot pick up treasure tokens & have no item slots.

**Apothecaries**  
Apothecaries start each game with a potion of healing. An apothecary may spend an action to give a potion to a member of the same warband within 1”, provided neither are in combat. The fig receiving the potion counts as having drunk it, & effects are applied immediately. Note that this rule applies to any potion carried by an apothecary, not just their free healing potion.

#### Creatures in Warbands
Some spells, & a few magic items, allow wizards to include creatures in their warbands. Creatures include anything listed in Chapter 6: Bestiary. The specific spell or item will state if the creature becomes a temporary or permanent member of the warband. If the creature is joining the warband temporarily, then it does not count against the normal max number of figs in the warband. Essentially, it is an extra member that will join for 1 game only. If the creature becomes a permanent member, then it takes the place of a soldier, counting towards the max warband size, & remaining with the warband from game to game until killed or dismissed. If the creature becomes a permanent member, the spell, item, or creature description will state if the creature counts as a standard or specialist soldier.

Among the spells are several 'control spells' (*Control Construct*, *Control Undead*, *Control Animal*, & *Control Demon*). Figs affected by a control spell are always temporary warband members. A caster may only control 1 creature of each type at any 1 time. Figs that are permanent members of a warband never count against this control limit, even if they're the same type (so an Enchanter can have 1 or more constructs in their warband & still 'control' 1 during a game).

Regardless of whether the creature is a permanent or temporary part of the warband, it follows all the rules for a soldier, including activating in the Soldier phase, unless otherwise stated. Creatures do not have item slots, & thus may never carry items. Creatures can carry treasure tokens unless otherwise stated.

#### General Arms & Armor List
In Frostgrave, weapons & armor are broken down into the classes listed below. The specific weapon inside a class makes no difference. Thus, in game terms, there's no difference between swords & hand-axes. It's perfectly legitimate for your soldier equipped with a hand weapon to be carrying a mace, axe, or sword. Should a player find or purchase a magic 'sword' it's more than acceptable to call the weapon an axe & have it depicted that way on the mini.

Some weapons have damage mods. This mod is added or subtracted to the damage inflicted after the winner of the combat has been determined as explained in Chapter 2: Playing the Game.

Although it's possible for a wizard or apprentice to carry more than 1 hand weapon, figs receives no bonus for doing so other than having a back-up should something happen to the primary weapon. Furthermore, no fig may ever wear more than 1 type of armor at a time, or carry more than 1 shield, although a fig wearing armor may also carry a shield.

**Dagger**  
This is a knife or other small weapon such as a light club. Daggers have a -1 damage mod. The first dagger carried by a fig does not take up an item slot. So, a wizard can carry a dagger, plus up to 5 other items.

**Hand Weapon**  
This includes any kind of weapon that is commonly wielded with 1 hand, including swords, scimitars, hand axes, maces, & even light spears. These weapons have no mods in combat.

**2-hand Weapon**  
This includes any kind of heavy melee weapon that requires 2 hands to wield, such as 2-handed swords, battle-axes, polearms, large flails, & heavy spears. These weapons do +2 damage. Because they're so bulky, these weapons take up 2 item slots. So, a wizard carrying a 2-handed weapon may only carry up to 3 other items.

**Staff**  
The staff is better known for its defensive properties. Staffs do -1 damage. In hand-to-hand combat, however, it also gives the opponent a -1 damage mod. The staff does not give this mod to shooting attacks. This category also includes magic staffs.

**Bow**  
The most common form of missile weapon in Frostgrave is the bow. The game makes no distinction between types of bow, & players are free to depict them as longbows, composite, etc. Bows are loaded & fired in a single action. For game purposes the max range is 24inch, as there should never be more than 24inch of open line-of-sight anywhere in the close confines of the Frozen City. In order to use a bow, a fig must also be carrying a quiver (which fills another item slot) or some type of magic ammo.

**Crossbow** 
Crossbows take 1 action to load & 1 action to fire. If a fig wishes, it may replace its movement action with a 'reload' action. Crossbows have a +2 damage mod. Crossbows also have a max range of 24inch. It's assumed all crossbows start the game loaded & ready. In order to use a crossbow, a fig must also be carrying a quiver (which fills another item slot) or some type of magic ammo.

**Quiver**  
Quivers are designed to carry arrows or crossbow bolts. A fig carrying a bow or crossbow must also carry a quiver, or some type of magic ammo, in order to make shooting attacks. A fig with a quiver can carry 1 piece of magic ammo, 1 magic arrow or crossbow bolt, without it taking up an item slot.

**Unarmed**  
If a model ends up with no weapons, it can fight as normal but suffers -2 Fight & a -2 damage mod. Creatures with no weapons listed in their notes fight with natural weapons & are thus never counted as unarmed.

**Shield**  
This can be any type of shield from a small buckler to a large tower shield. A fig that is carrying a shield receives +1 Armor, but may not also carry a 2-hand weapon or a staff. Casters cannot carry shields.

**Armor**  
Light armor grants +1 Armor. Heavy armor grants +2 Armor but suffers -1 Move. Casters cannot wear armor.
Permanent warband members may never have Armor Stat more than 15. If any combo of items, magic, or special affects would take them above 15, treat it as 15 instead. Creatures are not subject to this limit, even if they join a warband temporarily.

## Chapter 2: Playing the Game
Now that you have your wizard & their warband assembled, you are ready to get some miniatures on the table & start your explorations of the Frozen City! This chapter covers all the basic rules for the game including setting up the table, moving, fighting, casting spells, & how to control the creatures that often ambush wizards during their explorations.

#### Setting Up the Table
The first step in any game of Frostgrave is to set up the table. The easiest way to do this is to turn to Chapter 5: Scenarios & select a scenario, either by rolling randomly or simply agreeing with your opponent which 1 to play. This will tell you how to set up the terrain, where or how to place treasure, what kind of creatures might be wandering around, & what special rules are in effect.

Alternatively, you can ignore the scenarios & just play a 'standard' game. In a standard game, the players should take the terrain they have available & set it up on the table in a mutually agreeable fashion. The ruins of Frostgrave are a dense labyrinth of broken buildings, collapsed walls, shattered statues, & patches of ice & snow. In truth, the exact nature of the terrain isn't overly important. What is important is that there is a lot of it! The table should be crowded with terrain, leaving only a few areas or avenues of open ground, & giving figs plenty of places to hide & take cover. It really shouldn't be possible for a fig on the ground to draw line-of-sight to any point more than a foot or so away.

Once all the terrain is set up, the players should place 5 treasure tokens. The recovery of these tokens is the players' primary goal in the game. 1 treasure, known as the central treasure, should be placed in the exact center of the table, or as near to that point as is practical. Each player should then place 1 treasure token within 8inch of the central treasure token, but no closer than 6inch to any other treasure token. Finally, each player should place 1 final treasure token anywhere on the table, provided it is more than 9inch from any table edge & more than 6inch from any other treasure token. Always count vertical distance when checking how far treasure tokens are from 1 another. Remember that, when you are placing treasure tokens, you don't know which side of the table your warband will start on. Thus, if you place a treasure token that is too close to 1 side, & too easy to reach, you may have just given your opponent a free treasure!

After all the treasure tokens have been placed, each player should roll a die to determine which side of the table to set-up their warband. The player with the highest roll, re-rolling ties, gets to select their starting side. In a 2-player game, the other player will start on the opposite table side. In multiplayer games, the player with the second highest roll chooses their side second, & so on.

Once all the players have selected a starting table edge, the player that selected their side first should place all their figs on the table within 3inch of the table edge, & no closer than 6inch to either corner. The second player should then do the same, & so on until all the warbands are on the table.

It is worth noting that the dense terrain should ensure that no fig is able to draw line-of-sight to a fig in an opposing warband or to the central treasure token before it has moved. Ideally, this shouldn't even be possible until both sides have moved at least once. If this is not the case, consider adding more terrain or adjusting the terrain that is already on the table.
You are now ready to begin.

**Try the Corners**
In games played on very small tables, say 2x2ft, it might be better for warbands to select starting corners, instead of table edges, as this makes better use of the available space for playing a game. 4-way games played on 3x3ft tables might also consider using corners instead. In this case, set up all members of the warband within 4inch of the corner.  
If you are starting from corners, make sure all the players are aware of this before treasure tokens are placed. Treasure tokens should not be placed within 10inch of any starting corner if possible.

#### The Turn
Games of Frostgrave are divided into turns. During each turn, players will have a chance to activate all the figs in their warbands.

***Initiative***  
At the beginning of each turn, all players should make an Initiative Roll. Each player rolls a die, with the player who rolls highest becoming the primary player for that turn. The player who rolls the next highest becomes the secondary player for the turn, & so on. All ties should be re-rolled.

***Phases***  
Every turn is divided into 4 phases: the Wizard phase, the Apprentice phase, the Soldier phase, & the Creature phase. Once all 4 phases have been completed, the turn is over. Assuming the game is not over at this point, the players should once again make an Initiative Roll & begin another turn.

**Wizard Phase**  
The turn begins with the Wizard phase, in which the primary player must activate their wizard & 0--3 soldiers of their choice that started the phase within 3inch & in line-of-sight of the wizard. The player may activate these figs in any order; the wizard does not have to activate first. The secondary player must then activate their wizard & 0--3 soldiers within 3inch & in line-of-sight, & so on until all players have activated their wizards. If a player no longer has a wizard on the table, they may not activate any figs in this phase.

**Apprentice Phase**  
Once the Wizard phase is complete, the turn moves to the Apprentice phase, which is very similar. In this phase, the primary player must activate their apprentice & 0-3 soldiers of their choice within 3inch & in line-of-sight of the apprentice. These soldiers may not have been activated in the Wizard phase -- figs may only be activated once per turn, unless some special effect specifically says otherwise. Again, these figs may be activated in any order. The secondary player must then activate their apprentice & 0--3 soldiers within 3inch & in line-of-sight, & so on until all players have activated their apprentices. If a player no longer has an apprentice on the table, they may not activate any figs in this phase.

**Soldier Phase**  
After the Apprentice phase comes the Soldier phase, in which the primary player must activate all their soldiers that have not yet been activated in the turn. These soldiers should be activated 1 at a time, in whatever order the player wishes. The secondary player then does the same, & so on until all players have activated all their remaining soldiers.

**Creature Phase**  
Finally, the turn ends with the Creature phase. During this phase all uncontrolled creatures are activated in a manner specified by their rules. Creatures that are members of a warband, either temporarily or permanently, count as soldiers for the purposes of activation, & thus will activate in 1 of the first 3 phases of the turn.

#### Activation
When a fig is activated, it may perform 2 actions, 1 of which can only be movement. The other action can consist of a second move, fighting, shooting, spellcasting, or any of the special actions listed elsewhere in this book. It does not matter if a fig moves with its first or second action. Thus, for example, a fig may shoot a bow & then move, or move & then cast a spell. While every fig must activate during a turn, it is not required to take any or all its actions. It is fine for a fig to activate & do nothing, or to cast a spell & not move. There are situations in which a fig will only be allowed to perform 1 action. In this case, a fig may take any 1 action -- it does not have to be movement.

It should be noted that when activating soldiers in either the Wizard or Apprentice phase, it is those soldiers within 3inch of the wizard or apprentice at the beginning of the phase, & not after the wizard or apprentice has moved. Thus, a player may not move their wizard & then activate a soldier within 3inch who was not within 3inch before the wizard moved.

In any case, a fig must perform all its actions before another fig is activated.

***Group Activation***  
A special case, distinct from the normal activation explained above. Using a group activation allows the player to circumvent the normal activation rule that each fig activated in a phase must complete all its actions before another fig is activated.

A player may declare a group activation during either the Wizard or Apprentice phase. In this case, a player ***must*** move all the figs activating in that phase before any of them can perform a second action. For example, a player could not move an apprentice & 1 soldier, complete their actions, & then activate a second soldier. Actions that may normally replace a move action (e.g. reloading a crossbow) may not do so during a group activation.

After all the figs have moved, each 1 may then take a second action in whatever order the controlling player chooses. Thus, if a player declared a group activation during the Wizard phase, it is possible for them to move their wizard & up to 3 soldiers. The wizard could then cast a spell, followed by the 3 soldiers each taking their second actions in turn.

There are only a few instances where using a group activation is useful. The most common is to allow multiple figs to gang up on a specific enemy (see Multiple Combats), although there are also occasions where it can be useful to rearrange the positions of various figs to achieve better line-of-sight, or to allow figs to move past 1 another through tight confines, & so on.

***Stat Rolls***  
During the turn, a fig may be called upon to make a roll using 1 of its stats to accomplish a feat that is not covered by any of the general rules. In these cases, a fig will be told to make a Stat Roll, such as a Will Roll or Fight Roll, with a Target Number (TN) of X, where X is equal to the difficulty of the feat being attempted. This will usually be written like this: 'Make a Will Roll (TN16)'. In these situations, the player simply rolls a die & adds the appropriate stat. If the total is equal to or greater than the Target Number, the fig has succeeded in the task. If the total is less, it has failed.

For example, during a scenario, a treasure may be located behind a barred door. To break down the door, a fig must be adjacent to it & spend an action to make a Fight Roll (TN14). The player rolls a die, then adds the fig's Fight stat to the result. If this total is equal to or greater than 14, the fig has successfully broken open the door & the treasure is now in reach.

In theory, any stat may be the subject of a Stat Roll. For stats that are not listed with +/- (i.e. Movement, Armor, & Health), just roll & add the fig's current stat (e.g. in the case of Health, use the fig's current Health, not their max starting Health). If a fig has a split stat, use its current stat.

***Automatic Success & Failure & Max Bonuses***  
Whenever a fig makes a Stat Roll, including Will Rolls to resist spells, an unmodified roll of 20 is always a success. This is true even if the roll, after mods, still falls short of the Target Number. Conversely, an unmodified roll of 1 is always a failure. An unmodified roll means that this is the number showing on the die, before any mods are taken into account.

When a warband member makes a die roll of any type, including Stat Rolls, Combat Rolls, Shooting Rolls, Casting Rolls, etc., the fig may never have a total bonus greater than +10. If any combination of a fig's stats & mods results in a bonus above +10, treat the total as +10 instead.

For example, a wizard with Fight +5 is wielding a magic sword (+1 Fight) & has had the Strength spell cast on them (+2 Fight). They're in combat with an enemy model & have 2 supporting figs assisting them (+4 Fight). As those bonuses add up to +12, their Combat Roll is made with a +10 mod.

#### Movement
Any time a fig takes 2 or more actions during its activation, 1 of those actions must be movement (though there are a few exceptions noted elsewhere). The first time a fig moves in a phase, it may move up to its Move stat in inches. If the fig chooses to perform a second movement action during the phase (or even a third in rare occasions), it may move up to half its Move stat in inches. Thus, a fig with a Move stat of 5 can use 2 actions to move 7.5inch (5+2.5=7.5), or, if it has somehow acquired a third action, 10inch (5+2.5+2.5=10).

Movement does not have to be in a straight line, & the path taken by a fig can include as many turns as desired. However, the max movement distance is calculated off the actual ground covered by the fig, including all vertical distance. In the cluttered ruins of Frostgrave, figs will certainly be slowed down by weaving through the broken buildings.

Remember, when moving figs, that if you measure from the front of the base, it is the front of the base that moves the max distance & the rest of the fig should be placed behind this point. Or, to put it another way, don't measure from the front of a base, & then place the back of the base at the end of the measurement -- thus gaining the size of the base as 'extra' movement.

***Obstructions***  
Movement is simple when figs are moving down paths or through open terrain, but it becomes more difficult when faced with walls or mounds of rubble. Figs can climb or move over any obstacle at a cost of 2inch for every 1inch, or partial inch, of height. Unless specifically stated by a scenario, all terrain in Frostgrave may be climbed. This may, occasionally, lead to awkward situations where a fig ends its movement clinging to the side of a building or rock, where it is impossible to place the miniature. In such a case, just leave the fig at the bottom of the wall & place a small die next to it displaying the number of inches up the wall the fig is currently perched. Terrain such as stairs & ladders that were specifically built to be scaled may be climbed without penalty.

**Rough Ground**  
Along with buildings & walls, Frostgrave contains many areas of rough ground. Rough ground is any kind of terrain that is difficult to move over. It may be represented by areas of snow, mud, or rubble. The exact type of rough ground is irrelevant for movement purposes. When a fig moves across rough ground, every inch, or partial inch, of movement counts as 2inch for the purposes of calculating total movement. Thus, a fig with a Move stat of 6 could move 1inch through open ground, then 2inch through rough ground (counting as 4inch), & then a final 1inch on the other side. It is worth taking a few minutes before each game to discuss what counts as rough ground as this will help avoid any arguments later.

***Movement Into Combat***  
Any time a fig moves into contact with an enemy fig (either an opponent or an uncontrolled creature), it is considered to be ***in combat***. Figs in combat do not automatically fight -- this still requires 1 of the figs to perform a fight action, but the 2 figs are essentially locked together for the moment. This is explained further in the section on Combat. While a fig is in combat, the only action it may normally take is a fight action. A fig in combat may not move, shoot, cast a spell, drink a potion, reload a crossbow, or use a magic item. This may mean a fig is not able to move during the turn & thus will only take 1 action.

**Forcing Combat**  
Whenever a fig moves within 1inch of an enemy fig that is currently free to move (i.e. it is not in combat or unable to move because of a spell effect), the enemy fig may choose to ***force combat***. The enemy fig is immediately moved into contact with the currently active fig & the 2 are considered to be ***in combat***. This can happen at any point in the path of a fig's movement. This rule means that that a fig cannot run right past an opposing fig, & it allows figs to 'guard' narrow passageways & protect treasure & other figs. Note that uncontrolled creatures will ***always*** force combat if they have the opportunity, unless a creature's description states otherwise.

***Movement by Spell***  
There are several spells (such as Leap or Teleport) that allow or cause a fig to move. These actions are not considered movement actions. They're not subject to the rules concerning multiple moves, obstructions, or forced combat. However, a fig that uses spell movement & ends that move within 1inch of an opposing fig is subject to forced combat at that point. These spells may be used to move a fig out of combat.

***Movement off the Table***  
If a fig chooses to move off the table, such as to secure treasure or just to retreat from the fight, that fig is now out of the game & may not return. Figs can never be forced off the table involuntarily, either by being pushed back from combat, by the effects of a spell, or by any other means unless another rule specifically allows it. In cases where this would happen, move the fig to the edge of the table & leave it there. Figs that are under the temporary control of a wizard may be moved off the table, but only if they're carrying treasure. This treasure is then secured for the controlling wizard.

**Run For It!**  
When a fig is activated, but before it takes any actions, it may declare that it will run for it. The fig may immediately move up to 3inch in any direction, ignoring all movement mods. After this move, its activation ends. A fig may not move within 1inch of an enemy fig using this rule. This rule is useful to figs that would otherwise be reduced to almost no movement, such as 1 carrying a treasure token through rough ground while suffering from the effects of poison. A fig may not use this rule if it activates in combat, in deep water, or is entitled to no actions when it activates.

***Jumping***  
A fig may jump any distance provided it moves an equal distance in a straight line before making the jump, & the total movement does not exceed the max permitted to the fig for that activation. Jumping distance does count against a fig's total movement. So, a fig that moves 2.5inch in a straight line may then jump 2.5inch along the same line. It may then continue to move if it has a Move stat greater than 5. Otherwise, figs may jump a max of 1inch without any previous movement.

***Falling***  
It is possible that figs standing above the ground could fall over an edge, either by being pushed back in combat or by the effects of a spell. If the fig falls less than 3inch, the fall has no major effect & the fig can carry on as normal. If the fig falls 3inch or more, it suffers damage equal to the number of inches it fell multiplied by 1.5, rounded down. Thus, a fig falling 5inch suffers 7 damage (5x1.5=7.5, rounded to 7).

A fig may choose to fall voluntarily. This counts as a movement action & any distance fallen counts against the fig's total movement allowance for the activation. If a fig falls more inches than its Move stat, the fall uses up all its actions. Place it on the ground & end its activation immediately. Figs take damage as normal if they choose to fall voluntarily.

If a fig is standing closer than 1inch to an edge, & it is pushed back 1inch or more, for any reason, towards that edge, that fig falls automatically.

***Swimming***  
There is not a lot of standing water in Frostgrave; even the once mighty Meregile River is frozen. Still, in a magic city, anything is possible, & occasional pools, hot springs, & alchemical pits may be found. Furthermore, the rules for swimming are used in other situations as well, such as falling in tar, quicksand, & the like.

In ***Frostgrave***, water, & all other liquid bodies, is divided into 2 types: ***shallow*** & ***deep***. Shallow water counts as rough ground but causes no other penalties. All water is assumed to be shallow unless the players or scenario specifically state otherwise.

Deep water is deep enough that it cannot be waded through, so if you want to move in deep water you must swim. Whenever a fig activates while in deep water, it must make a Swimming Roll. This is essentially a special version of a Stat Roll. To make a Swimming Roll, the fig must make a Will Roll (TN5), taking into account the mods on the ***Swimming Mods Table***. If the fig succeeds, it activates as normal. If the fig fails, it receives no actions this turn & also takes damage equal to the amount by which it failed its Swimming Roll.

Swimming Mods Table
| Armor Type        | Mod |
| ----------------- | --- |
| Armor(L)          | -2  |
| Armor(H)          | -5  |
| Shield            | -1  |
| Carrying Treasure | -2  |

For example, a tracker activates while in deep water. They must immediately make a Will Roll with a Target Number of 5. They have a Will of +1, but their light armor provides a -2 mod. They roll a 3, for a final total of 2. So, not only does the tracker receive no actions this turn, but they also take 3 points of damage.

Deep water is treated as rough ground for the purposes of movement. Any fig fighting while in deep water suffers a -2 Fight (this can apply to both figs in the combat).

Figs that have the Aquatic, Amphibious, Ethereal, or Flying traits do not have to make Swimming Rolls, suffer no movement penalties in either deep or shallow water, & do not suffer a Fight penalty for being in water. Creatures that do not have the Amphibious, Aquatic, Ethereal, or Flying traits will never intentionally enter deep water & will ignore figs in it for the purposes of determining movement.

No fig may make a shooting attack with a bow or crossbow while in deep water, but spells may be cast normally.

#### Combat
Once a fig is in combat with an enemy fig, it may spend 1 of its actions to fight. It is not required to do this, but generally its only other option is to do nothing as figs are not allowed to move, shoot, reload, drink a potion, use an item, or cast a spell while in combat. In a fight, each fig makes a ***Combat Roll*** by rolling a die & adding its Fight stat & any relevant mods. The fig with the higher score wins the fight & may inflict damage on its opponent. To determine damage, the winning fig takes its Combat Roll, adds any damage mods granted by its weaponry, & subtracts the loser's Armor stat. If the result is a positive number, this is the amount of damage inflicted. This damage is then subtracted from the Health of the loser (this is explained more fully under Damage). In some rare cases, an attack might include a ***damage multiplier*** (e.g. the ice toad has the Powerful trait & any damage dealt by its attacks is doubled), which is applied once the base damage from the attack has been calculated. In the event that the Combat Rolls are tied, the 2 figs land their strikes simultaneously -- both are considered to be the winner & both might take damage.

For example, a knight (Fight +4, Armor 13, hand weapon) & a thug (Fight +2, Armor 10, hand weapon) are currently in combat. The knight uses an action to fight & both figs make a Combat Roll. The knight rolls a 13 to which they add their Fight stat of +4 for a total of 17. The thug rolls a 7 & adds their Fight +2 for a total of 9. Since the knight's Combat Roll of 17 beats the thug's Combat Roll of 9, the knight has won the fight. To determine the damage, the knight takes their Combat Roll of 17 & subtracts the thug's Armor stat of 10 to reveal that 7 points of damage have been inflicted. This damage is immediately subtracted from the thug's current Health total.

Once a winner has been determined & any damage inflicted, the winner of the fight has a decision to make. They can either have the 2 figs ***remain in combat***, or can ***push back*** 1 of them (either their own fig or their opponent's) by 1inch. This move must be 1inch directly away from the opposing fig. This move is not affected by rough terrain, though walls & other barriers will make it impossible. It is possible for a fig to be pushed over an edge in this manner. No figs can force combat on a fig that is being moved 1inch as the result of combat. A fig cannot force combat against an opposing fig that just pushed it back, or that pushed back from combat with it, unless the opposing fig subsequently moves closer. Uncontrolled creatures will always choose to stay in combat unless a specific rule says otherwise.

If the winner decides to push back either fig, the figs are no longer considered to be in combat. If the fig that initiated the fight still has another action to use in this activation, it may now do so, remembering that, in most cases, this action can only be movement, as the fig will already have taken 1 non-movement action in this activation. If the fight was a tie, neither fig is moved, & they remain in combat. If a character wins a fight against 1 fig, but is currently also in combat with another, it may not choose to move back, it may only remain in combat or push back its opponent.

Winning a fight & pushing a fig back is generally the only way for a fig to escape from being in combat, unless a caster outside of the fight changes the situation (by casting a movement spell on 1 of the figs, for instance).

***Multiple Combats***  
During the course of a game, it is quite possible that a group of figs will end up clustered together, & figs will be in combat with 2 or more enemies at the same time.

Although this may seem confusing at first, it is actually pretty simple to unravel. When a fig in combat with multiple opponents spends an action to fight, it must first nominate which opposing fig it is fighting. The fight is then carried out in the normal way, with the addition of the following mod:

Multiple Combat Mod Table
| Circumstance      | Mod | Notes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| ----------------- | --- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Supporting Fig | +2  | Every friendly fig also in combat with the target fig & not in combat with another fig gives +2. This is cumulative, so 3 eligible supporting figs would grant +6 mod. Note that only 1 fig per combat may end up with a mod from supporting figs, so if both figs are eligible for a +2 mod they cancel each other out & both figs at +0. Similarly, if 1 is eligible for a +4 mod & the other for a +2, the first fights at +2 & the second at +0. A fig may never claim more than +6 from supporting figs. |

Combats in Frostgrave can get messy & turn into big brawls. Just remember a few key points & you should not have any trouble dealing with these situations.  
• Only 2 models -- the attacker & the declared target -- are actually fighting.  
• Only these 2 models can win or lose the fight & suffer damage.  
• They will be supported by any friendly models who are also in combat with the model they're fighting & not in combat with any additional enemy. This support does not require the supporting fig to spend an action.  
• Mods granted by supporting figs cancel out, so there will never be a case in which both figs receive a bonus to their fight because of friendly figs in the combat.  
• The max bonus that any warband member can have to its Combat Roll is +10.

***Combat Summary***  
1. Both figs make a Combat Roll -- roll a die & add the fig's Fight stat & any other relevant mods (e.g. bonuses from magic or supporting figs).  
2. Determine the winner by comparing Combat Rolls -- highest wins.  
3. Add any damage mods (such as +2 for a 2-handed weapon or -1 for a dagger) to the winner's Combat Roll.  
4. Subtract the opponent's Armor stat from this total.  
5. Apply any damage multipliers.  
6. If the final total is greater than 0, subtract that many points from the loser's Health. If it is 0 or negative, no damage is done.  
7. The winner now has the choice to remain in combat or push either themselves or their opponent back by 1inch.

#### Shooting
If a fig is equipped with a bow or crossbow, it may spend an action to make a shooting attack. A fig may only make 1 shooting attack per activation. Before declaring a shooting attack, a fig should check that its target is both ***in range*** & ***in line-of-sight***. To check range, simply measure the distance between the shooter & the target. All shooting attacks have a max range of 24inch unless otherwise stated. Line-of-sight is a bit trickier to determine. The easiest way is to put your eye down as close to the shooting fig as possible & see if you can see its target. Failing that, you can use string or a laser pointer to draw a line between the shooter & target to see if anything is in the way. If a line can be drawn from the head of the shooting fig to the head or torso of the target fig, it is considered to be in line-of-sight.

Once range & line-of-sight have been confirmed, a shooting attack is resolved in a similar way to melee combat. The shooter makes a ***Shooting Roll***, rolling a die & adding their Shoot stat. The target makes a Combat Roll, much as for melee combat, by adding its Fight stat & any relevant ***shooting defense mods*** (see below) to the roll of a die. Once both figs have a final score, the 2 are compared. If the Shooting Roll is higher, then the target is hit & damage is determined. If the target's Combat Roll is higher score, or the scores are equal, then the shot has missed -- either the shooter's aim was off, or the target was able to duck out of the way in the nick of time.

Damage is determined in the same way as for melee combat. The shooter takes their final Shooting Roll, adds any relevant damage mods & subtracts the target's Armor stat. If the result is a positive number, that is the amount of damage inflicted.

***For example***: an archer with a Shoot stat of +2 fires their bow at a thug with Fight +2. The thug is standing in the open & there are no other mods. The archer rolls an 8 & adds their Shoot stat of +2 for a total of 10. The thug rolls a 2 & adds their Fight stat of +2 for a total of 4. The archer has scored higher & thus has hit their target. Unfortunately, the archer's total of 10 is the same as the thug's Armor, so no damage is caused. The arrow apparently just nicked their sleeve.

Figs in combat may not make a shooting attack, nor may they reload a crossbow.

When a wizard or apprentice casts a spell that generates a shooting attack, that attack follows all the same rules, except the caster does not apply their Shoot stat to the roll. Instead, they should apply the bonus indicated in the spell. So, if a wizard casts Elemental Bolt, they would roll a die & add +7 to the roll, ignoring their Shoot stat. The target would make a Combat Roll, applying the standard shooting defense mods below.

***Shooting Defense Mods***  
All mods to shooting are expressed as bonuses to the target's Combat Roll. These mods apply to all shooting attacks, both magic & mundane.

| ------------------- | --- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Intervening Terrain | +1  | Every piece of intervening terrain between the shooter and the target gives a +1. This is cumulative, so three pieces of intervening terrain would provide a +3 modifier. Note that if the target is in base contact with a terrain piece, it counts as cover instead of intervening terrain. If the shooter is in base contact with a terrain piece, it does not count as intervening terrain, though it may block line-of-sight. Other figs do count as intervening terrain. |
| Cover, Light        | +2  | The target is in contact with solid cover (e.g. rocks, walls, thick wood, other figs) that obscures up to half of its body, or with soft cover (e.g. bushes, undergrowth) that almost completely obscures its body.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Cover, Heavy        | +4  | The target is in contact with solid cover that almost completely obscures its body.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Hasty Shot          | +1  | Shooter previously moved during this activation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Large Target        | -2  | Target is tall or unusually broad. Normally only applies to creatures with Large trait.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

***Shooting Into Combat***  
Shooting into combat is a risky move and even the best marksmen stand an equal chance of hitting friend instead vs foe. It's impossible to target a fig in combat -- but the combat itself may be targeted. If a fig wishes to shoot into the combat, it must first roll randomly to determine which fig in the combat is the actual target. Once this has been determined, it's too late for the shooter to hold fire -- it must carry out a shooting attack in the normal fashion, even if it's against a friendly fig. A fig can target any combat in which it can see at least 1 fig -- in this way, it is possible to hit a fig that is not in line-of-sight of the shooter.  

If the shooting attack generates an area effect, such as the Grenade or Elemental Ball spell, don't roll for a random target. Instead, if 1 fig in the combat is within the area, roll an attack against every fig in the combat.

***Shooting Summary***  
1. Shooter checks range and line-of-sight, then declares their target.  
2. Shooter makes a Shooting Roll -- roll & add the fig’s Shoot stat.  
3. Target makes a Combat Roll -- roll & add its Fight stat & any relevant shooting defense mods.  
4. Determine winner by comparing shooter’s Shooting Roll to target’s Combat Roll -- highest wins.  
5. If target wins, or scores are equal, attack misses.  
6. If shooter wins, add any damage mods (such as +2 for a  
crossbow) to Shooting Roll.  
7. Subtract opponent’s Armor stat from total.  
8. Apply damage multipliers.  
9. If final total greater than 0, subtract that many points from target’s Health. If it's 0 or negative, no damage is done.

#### Damage
Whenever a fig takes damage, it's subtracted from the fig’s current Health total. If this takes a fig to 0 Health or less, that fig is killed & removed from the table.

In campaigns, the fig may not actually be dead, but is certainly out of the current game. After the game, a player can check to see what has become of any of their figs that were reduced to 0 Health or less.

Occasionally, damage is given a specific type, such as 'elemental damage' or 'magic damage'; this is because some magic items may mitigate certain types of damage, or some creatures may only be affected by certain types. This is also true of attacks, which can have descriptors such as 'elemental magic attack', meaning the attack causes both elemental and magic damage.

***Poison***  
Regardless whether it's venom delivered by bite or sting, or poison absorbed through touch or consumption, the rules are the same.

A fig that's poisoned or takes at least 1 point of damage from a creature with the Poison trait, is reduced to a single action per activation instead of the normal 2. This action can be anything -- it does not have to be movement.

A fig can be cured of poison if it receives any form of healing that increases the figs current Health. Otherwise, it may be cured by spells or magic items that specifically state they cure poison. Poison lasts until the end of a scenario. A fig is assumed to have recovered by the start of the next game.

A fig may only be poisoned once at any given time. Multiple poisonings have no additional effect. If a fig is already down to 1 action per activation due to another rule, then the poison has no additional effect.

#### Spellcasting
Wizards & apprentices may use an action to attempt to cast a spell. If, by some means, they have 3 actions during their activation, they may attempt to cast 2 spells in the same activation, but this is the absolute max. A fig may not cast a spell while in combat. A caster may attempt to cast any spell they know. There's no max to the number of times a specific spell may be cast during a game.

Chapter 4: Spells contains details on all the spells available to casters in Frostgrave.

***Success and Failure***  
To cast a spell, the player must announce which spell the caster is attempting & the target of that spell. The player then makes a Casting Roll & compares the result to the spell’s casting number.

The spell succeeds if the number rolled is ***equal to or greater than the casting number***. Be aware that in some cases, it's important to know the actual result on the die, not just whether the roll succeeded or failed.

If the roll is ***less than the casting number***, the spell fails and the action is lost. Furthermore, the caster may suffer damage from the failed spell as outlined in the ***Spell Failure Table*** below. Spells that are cast Out of Game do not cause damage, no matter how badly they were failed.

Spell Failure Table
| Amount Roll Failed | Damage Taken |
| ------------------ | ------------ |
| 1-4                | None         |
| 5-9                | 1dmg         |
| 10-19              | 2dmg         |
| 20+                | 5dmg         |

**Empowering Spells**  
After a Casting Roll is made and any other bonuses and mods (e.g. from the gloves of casting magic item) are applied, but before any effects are determined, a caster may choose to empower a spell. A caster may trade their Health to increase the Casting Roll on a 1-for-1 basis.

Unless otherwise specified, empowerment can never increase a Casting Roll above 18. For example, a wizard attempts to cast a crucial spell & declares that they're using their gloves of casting to add +5. They roll 10+5=15. The wizard could empower the spell by up to +3, up to 18. If the wizard had rolled a 15 (+5 for a total of 20), no empowerment would be possible, as the Casting Roll was already higher than 18.

Spells cast Out of Game may not be empowered.  
The most common use of empowerment is to spend just enough Health to ensure a spell is successful. Thus, if a wizard fails their Casting Roll by 1, they may spend 1 Health and the spell will succeed.

A caster may also use empowerment to increase their Casting Roll beyond what was needed for the spell to simply succeed. This tactic could be used to make it harder for a target to resist a spell (see Resisting Spells, opposite)  
or to increase the effects of the spell (e.g. Summon Demon could be empowered to summon a major demon). Any empowering must be done before the Will Roll to resist is made.

The final use of empowerment is to spend Health in order to take less damage. This is really only useful in the rare cases where a wizard fails a Casting Roll by 20+. In such cases, they may empower a spell so that they only fail by 19, thus taking less damage.

There are some magic items that allow casters to empower spells without spending Health, and these are detailed under their specific entries in Chapter 3: The Campaign.

**Death by Spellcasting**  
A caster is allowed to take themselves to 0 Health in order to empower a spell. This will remove the caster from the table before the effects of the spell are determined. Thus any spell, or part of a spell, that would have affected the caster no longer has a target. For example, if a Necromancer used their last point of Health in order to cast Steal Health, the target would still make a Will Roll & take damage as normal, but the caster would not gain any Health as they had already been removed from the table.

**Casting Roll Minimum**  
If a spell is successfully cast, but its final Casting Roll including empowerment is less than 14, treat the result as 14 instead. This is important for such things as resisting spells.

***Resisting Spells***  
The effects of some spells can be resisted with a Will Roll. If a Will Roll is allowed, the target of the spell is permitted (but not required) to roll a die and add their Will stat. If this total meets or beats the Casting Roll of the spell (including any empowerment), then the target has successfully resisted the spell and the spell has no effect. The caster still loses their action and any Health they used to empower the spell.

Unless otherwise stated, making a Will Roll does not cost an action, regardless of whether it is successful or not.

Because of the special knowledge that casters have of magic, they're allowed to empower their Will Rolls to resist spells. After they make their Will Roll, they may increase the result by spending their own Health on a 1-for-1 basis. If they have any magic items that can be used to empower spells, these may also be tapped for the purposes of empowering a Will Roll. There is no upper limit to empowering a Will Roll.

Like all Stat Rolls, a Nat20 on a Will Roll is an automatic success, and a Nat1 is an automatic failure. In these cases, no empowering is allowed.

***Cancelling Spells***  
If a spell has an ongoing effect, & no duration is given by the spell itself, then that spell lasts until the end of the game. Spells cannot be 'cancelled' or 'undone' by the caster, unless the spell specifically gives that ability, nor is a spell ended when the caster leaves the table or is killed. Generally, spells only end if specifically cancelled by some other effect such as a Dispel or Spelleater spell or a bottle of null.

***Targeting Figs in Combat***  
If a spell generates a shooting attack, and the caster wishes to target a fig in combat, then the caster must roll randomly to see which of the figs in combat is targeted by the attack. Otherwise, all spells may be cast on figs in combat and always target the intended fig.

***Casting Spells from Scrolls***  
Scrolls can be used in 2 different ways. If a caster has a scroll of a spell they don’t know, they may use it to cast that spell. In this case, they simply spend an action, the scroll is destroyed, and the spell successfully cast. Treat the Casting Roll for the spell as 14, regardless of the casting number.

If the scroll contains a spell the caster does know, they may use it as a form of spellcasting insurance. The caster may attempt to cast the spell as normal. If they fail their Casting Roll, they may use the scroll. The scroll is destroyed, and the spell is successfully cast. Treat the Casting Roll for the spell as 14, regardless of the spell’s casting number. In this case, the caster takes no damage from failing their Casting Roll. A scroll may be used in this way even if the Casting Roll was a Nat1.

Spells cast from scrolls can't be empowered. Casters never earn XP for spells cast from scrolls. Non-casters cannot use scrolls.

#### Using Potions
On any activation that a fig is not In Combat they may use an action to drink a potion. This action can replace a fig’s movement action. The effect of the potion is immediate and automatically successful. Unless stated otherwise in the description, the effects of a potion last until the end of the current game. Any ongoing effects granted by a potion are cancelled by anything that cancels spells, such as a Dispel spell or a bottle of null, unless the potion description specifically states otherwise.

Any fig that can carry an item may carry and use potions. A fig may not give a potion to another fig, with the exception of the apothecary.  

All potions are 1-use items and should be removed from the Wizard Sheet after they're used.

#### Collecting Treasure
If a fig is in contact with a treasure token, it may spend an action to pick up the treasure. No fig may pick up treasure if there is an enemy fig, either an uncontrolled creature or a member of a rival warband, within 1inch of the treasure or of the fig. Once a treasure token is picked up, it should be moved with the fig carrying it.

A fig may only carry 1 treasure token at a time and is slowed while doing so -- its Move is halved. Furthermore, if it's already carrying a shield, 2-handed weapon, staff, bow, or crossbow, it's also encumbered, and has -1 Fight (those lightly armed thieves and thugs really come into their own once they get their hands on treasure!).

A fig may spend an action to drop a treasure token it is carrying. This action can replace the usually mandatory move action. Move the fig & the treasure token slightly apart so that they're no longer touching. Any friendly fig may now spend an action to pick up the treasure (enemy figs would not be able to pick it up due to the proximity of the fig that just dropped it). If a fig carrying treasure is killed, leave the treasure token on the spot where they fell.

If a fig carrying treasure moves off the table, that treasure has been secured. That fig & that treasure are now out of the game.

Treasure has no particular use during the game. In the heat of battle, figs are far too busy fighting for their lives to thoroughly examine their loot. Chapter 3: The Campaign goes into detail on the exact nature of treasure & rules for what can be done with it, but this is all handled after the game is over.

It's worth noting that treasure tokens are not items. All figs can carry 1 & only 1 treasure token, regardless of the number of items they have or can carry, & treasure doesn't take up any item slots.

#### Creature Actions
The Creature phase is the last phase in every turn, in which all creatures that aren't part of a warband (called ‘uncontrolled creatures’) take their actions. Creatures that are part of a warband, even if only temporarily, activate as though they were a Soldier. Thus they can be activated along with either a wizard or apprentice, or they'll activate in the Soldier phase.

Like most figs, a creature may perform 2 actions when it's activated. While more powerful & intelligent creatures may have specific rules for their actions (explained fully in their Bestiary entries or in specific scenarios), the more commonly encountered creatures all follow a simple set of guidelines to determine how they act in any given turn.

Creatures that are not part of a warband will never target or attack another uncontrolled creature. They're not considered to be in combat with each other, even if their bases are touching. Creatures will always force combat with a warband member that moves within 1inch of it.

Starting with the creature with the current highest Health stat the players should go through the following steps for each creature to determine its actions. Run through the steps for each of the creature’s actions, as situations may change between them (e.g. a creature may be moving towards 1 target with a movement action when a second, closer target then becomes visible and thus becomes the target of its second movement action).

***1. Is the Creature in Combat?***
YES: It will use its action to fight. If it wins the combat, it will choose to stay in combat. If a creature is in combat with more than 1 opponent, it will attack the 1 with the lowest current Health.  
NO: Proceed to Step 2.

2. Is There A Warband Member in Line-of-Sight?
YES: If the creature is armed with a missile weapon, and there is a warband member within range, it will shoot at the closest eligible target. It will take no second action. If the creature has no missile weapon, it will move as far as it can towards the closest visible warband member, climbing obstacles as necessary. The creature will move into combat if possible. If the creature has moved into combat and has an action remaining go to Step 1.  
NO: Proceed to Step 3.

***3. Random Movement***
The creature will take an action to move. Determine a random direction and move the creature its full Move distance in that direction. If the creature moves into a wall or other obstacle (including the edge of the table -- creatures will never leave the table due to random movement), halt its movement at that point. Once this movement is complete, if the creature has an action remaining, check Step 2 once more -- if no target has presented itself, the creature’s activation ends, & no second action is taken, otherwise, proceed with Step 2 as normal.

A simple method for this is to roll a die. Since each facing of a d20 is a triangle, it can serve as a little arrow. Simply look at the direction indicated by the top of the triangle -- the point that sits above the number.

#### Ending the Game
Games of Frostgrave can end in several ways. Most commonly, a game ends as soon as the last treasure token is moved off the table. All figs that are still on the table are assumed to make it home safely.

Another way the game can end is if only 1 player has figs left on the table, either because all the opposing warband members are dead or have moved off the table. In this case, the player with figs remaining secures all the treasures that are currently being carried by members of their warband. Furthermore, they should roll for each unclaimed treasure on the table. On a 15+ they secure that treasure as well. Failure results in the treasure lost.

In the incredibly rare but theoretically possible event that no player has any figs left on the table, the game ends & all treasures left are lost.

Some scenarios may have specific objectives that end the game as soon as they're achieved. These cases will be explained in the specific scenario.

In non-campaign games, the winning player is the 1 who secures the most treasures. In a campaign, there's no specific win condition for most scenarios, & each player is left to decide for themselves whether their wizard 'won' or 'lost' the encounter.

## Chapter 3: The Campaign
While it's perfectly fine to play a 1-off game of Frostgrave, many players will find it much more satisfying to play a campaign of interconnected games. During a campaign, players can use the treasure they collect during games to hire new soldiers, buy magic equipment, & improve their headquarters. Also, as wizards progress through a campaign, they will gain XP, allowing them to improve their stats, learn new spells, & become more proficient at casting the spells they already know. This chapter provides players with all the info they need to know in order to take their wizards through a campaign.

After each scenario, each player should follow these steps in this order:  
1. Injury and Death  
2. Out of Game Spells  
3. Experience and Level  
4. Counting Treasure  
5. Spend Treasure

#### Injury & Death
In a standard game, any fig reduced to 0 Health is assumed to be dead. In a campaign game, however, a fig with 0 Health is ‘out of the game’, but not necessarily dead. It may be that this fig has been knocked unconscious, is too badly wounded to continue to fight, or has simply lost their nerve and run away.

The first thing a player needs to do at the end of a campaign game is to check the status of the figs that were knocked out of the game (i.e. reduced to 0 Health or less).

***Soldiers***  
For soldiers, roll on the:

Soldier Survival Table
| d20 | Result        |
| --- | ------------- |
| 1-4 | Dead          |
| 5-8 | Badly Wounded |
| 9+  | Full Recovery |

**Dead**  
The soldier has been killed & should be removed from the Wizard Sheet. Any items this soldier was carrying are lost.

**Badly Wounded**  
The soldier is injured. They can remain in the warband, & on the Wizard Sheet, but they can't participate in the next game while they're recovering from their wounds. After missing 1 game, they'll return for the next game with full Health.

**Full Recovery**  
The soldier recovers quickly from their ordeal & will return for the next game with full Health.

***Wizards & Apprentices***  
For wizards & apprentices, roll on the Caster Survival Table. When checking for a wizard’s survival, a player has the option to modify the roll by +1 after they've rolled.

Caster Survival Table
| d20 | Result           |
| --- | ---------------- |
| 1-2 | Dead             |
| 3-4 | Permanent injury |
| 5-6 | Badly wounded    |
| 7-8 | Close call       |
| 9+  | Full recovery    |

**Dead**  
The caster doesn’t survive their injuries. See the section on recruiting new warband members in 'Spending Treasure' for what to do when your wizard or apprentice dies.

**Permanent Injury**  
The caster suffers an injury that never fully heals. Roll on the Permanent Injury Table below to determine the exact nature of the injury. Otherwise, the fig returns for the next game with full Health.

**Badly Wounded**  
The caster has received a major injury that will take time to heal. The player has a choice: they can either play the next game without the injured caster, or can pay 150gc for medical treatment. A 100gc discount applies to this amount if there's an apothecary in the warband. If the wizard doesn't have the appropriate amount, they're allowed to go into debt to pay the fee. However the wizard may not spend any gold until this debt is paid in full.

**Close Call**  
The caster escapes with no major injury, but loses all the items they were carrying. Items from the 'General Arms & Armor' Table are replaced for free.

**Full Recovery**  
The caster’s injuries prove to be relatively minor, & they return at full strength in the next game.

***Permanent Injuries***  
Whenever a caster receives a permanent injury, this should be listed in the notes for this fig on the Wizard Sheet. When a caster receives an injury that causes a penalty to 1 of its stats, the player should write that stat as a split stat. So, a wizard that goes into the game having a Fight stat of +3, but receives a Crushed Arm, should write the stat as +3/+2.

This is very important for record-keeping. The first number in a split stat is the caster’s actual level of ability, & should be used to determine if the caster has reached their max potential in a given stat. It should also be used to generate the corresponding stat for an apprentice. It will also be the number that corresponds to the ‘level’ of the wizard (see Experience & Level, below). For the purposes of any rolls pertaining to the stat however, the second number should be used.

Permanent Injury Table
| d20   | Injury                |
| ----- | --------------------- |
| 1-2   | Lost toes             |
| 3-6   | Smashed leg           |
| 6-10  | Crushed arm           |
| 11-12 | Lost fingers          |
| 13-14 | Never quite as strong |
| 15-16 | Psychological scars   |
| 17-18 | Niggling injury       |
| 19    | Smashed jaw           |
| 20    | Lost eye              |

**Lost Toes**  
The caster has lost 1 or more toes and suffers a permanent -1 penalty to all Move Rolls. This injury can be received twice, with a cumulative effect of -2 to all Move Rolls. Any further Lost Toes results must be re-rolled.

**Smashed Leg**  
The caster suffers permanent bone or muscle damage in their leg & suffers a permanent -2 Move penalty. This injury can be received twice, with a cumulative effect of -4 to Move. Any further Smashed Leg results must be re-rolled.

**Crushed Arm**  
The caster suffers permanent bone or muscle damage in their arm and suffers a permanent -1 Fight penalty. This injury can be received twice, with a cumulative effect of -2 Fight. Any further Crushed Arm results must be re-rolled.

**Lost Fingers**  
The caster has lost 1 or more fingers & suffers a permanent -1 Shoot penalty. This injury can be received twice, with a cumulative effect of -2 Shoot. Any further Lost Fingers results must be re-rolled.

**Never Quite As Strong**  
Due to internal injuries, the caster never quite returns to full Health & starts every game at -1 Health. This injury can be received twice, with a cumulative effect of -2 Health. Any further Never Quite as Strong results must be re-rolled.

**Psychological Scars**  
The caster’s physical injuries fully heal, but the mental trauma remains, causing a permanent -1 Will penalty. This injury can be received twice, with a cumulative effect of -2 Will. Any further Psychological Scars results must be re-rolled.

**Niggling Injury**  
The caster’s injury just never quite heals, & they're forced to use herbs, ointments, or minor magic to keep the pain at bay. The caster must spend 30gc on these treatments before each game or start each game at -3 Health. This injury can be received twice -- in which case the payment increases to 40gc and the penalty to -4 Health. Any further Niggling Injury results must be re-rolled. A 10gc discount applies to these payments for each apothecary in the warband.

**Smashed Jaw**  
The caster suffered a broken jaw that never quite healed properly. The caster has some difficulty with speaking, which affects their ability to lead their warband. Whenever this fig activates, it can only activate a max of 2 soldiers in its phase (not the normal 3). An apprentice with a Smashed Jaw could only activate 2 soldiers in the Apprentice phase. If this injury is received a second time, the number of soldiers that may also activate in the phase is decreased to 1. Any further Smashed Jaw results must be re-rolled.

**Lost Eye**  
1 of the fig’s eyes has been damaged & rendered useless. It suffers a -1 to its Combat Roll whenever it's the target of a shooting attack. If a caster receives 2 Lost Eye permanent injuries, they are effectively blind. If the warband’s wizard fails to successfully cast Miraculous Cure to remove permanent injuries (note that a wizard may cast this spell on themselves or on their apprentice) in the following Out of Game spells step of the post-game sequence, the caster must retire from exploring Frostgrave and is considered 'dead' for game purposes.

#### Out of Game Spells
Out of Game (A) spells may be attempted at this point. The wizard & apprentice may each attempt to cast each relevant spell once after each game. These spells may not be empowered, nor is damage taken from failing to cast them. No XP is earned for casting Out of Game spells.

#### Experience & Level
Over the course of a campaign, a wizard will learn from their adventures, gaining valuable wisdom and knowledge. In game terms, this is represented in 2 ways: XP and Level.

***Experience***  
Only wizards gain XP, not apprentices. During each game, a wizard’s achievements can earn them XP as outlined in the Experience Table.
The rewards listed in the table only apply to actions that take place during a game. No XP is earned for casting Out of Game spells.  
A wizard may earn a max of 300xp per game.

| +5  | For each failed attempt to cast a spell that results in either the wizard or apprentice suffering damage.                                                                                                                                                                               |
| +10 | For each spell successfully cast by either the wizard or apprentice. No experience points are gained for casting a spell with a casting number of 6 or less.                                                                                                                            |

| +40 | For each treasure token secured by the wizard or their warband.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| +5  | For each uncontrolled creature killed by the wizard or their warband; max +50 per game. Does not apply to creatures that have a specific experience point reward given in a scenario, nor to creatures specifically created or summoned by a member the wizard’s warband. |

Most scenarios will provide other ways in which XP can be acquired. It is useful to jot down any XP earned at the time so that it is not forgotten at the end of a game.

After each game, the wizard should total up the XP they've gained & add this to the amount with which they began the game. Every full 100xp may now be converted into a Level. A wizard doesn't have to convert their XP into Levels immediately and may bank it for later.

***Level***  
Generally, wizards of the same (or similar) level will be close to 1 another in terms of power, even if their abilities vary wildly. All starting wizards are level 0. A level 20 wizard is much more powerful. Compared to a level 0 wizard, they will almost certainly have better stats, know more spells, & have lower casting numbers for those spells. A level 40 wizard will be that much more powerful again.

For every level a wizard gains, they may choose to **improve a stat**, **improve a known spell**, or **learn a new spell**.

Remember that whenever a wizard advances in some way, their apprentice will also advance.

**Improving A Stat**  
The wizard may improve 1 of the following stats by +1, up to the max shown in brackets: Fight (+5), Shoot (+5), Will (+8), Health (20). A wizard may only improve 1 stat after each game, even if they gained multiple levels -- so, a wizard who gained 2 levels could increase their Fight by +1 or their Health by 1, but not both.

**Improving A Known Spell**  
The wizard can focus on any spell they know in order to lower the casting number by -1. The min casting number for any spell is 5, & can go no lower than this, no matter how much the wizard might want to improve upon it. All spells may be reduced to a casting number of 5, regardless of their school & the wizard’s relationship to that school. A wizard may only improve 1 known spell after each game, even if they gained multiple levels -- so, a wizard who gained 2 levels could improve Petrify by -1 or Leap by -1, but not both.

**Learning A New Spell**  
The wizard may learn a new spell for which they have a grimoire in their vault. They may not however, improve a spell they have just learned until another game has been played. The hunt for ancient magic is a wizard’s true obsession, so a wizard may learn as many new spells after each game as their available levels & grimoires permit -- so, a wizard who gained 2 levels & had grimoires for Plague of Insects & Blinding Light in their vault could learn both new spells.

#### Counting Treasure
In 1-off games, treasure is only used to determine the winner. In a campaign however, treasure is a crucial element in the progression & improvement of a wizard & their warband.

For each treasure token their warband managed to get off the table, they get 1 roll on the **Treasure Table** below.

If the player recovered the central treasure, they have the option to re-roll their first roll on the Treasure Table but must accept the result of the second roll. This decision must be made after the first roll, but before any rolls are made on any sub-table.

***Gold Crowns***  
Add that many gold crowns (gc) to the wizard’s treasury on the Wizard Sheet. These gold crowns can be spent in a number of ways (see Spending Treasure).

***Potions***  
The number given in brackets indicates how many potions are found -- roll that many times on the Lesser Potion Table. If the result is 19 or 20, the player should roll again on the Greater Potion Table. These tables also list the purchase price for which a wizard may buy a potion, & the sale price for which a wizard can sell an unwanted 1. The Greater Potion Table also includes & ingredient cost that wizards must pay when attempting to create them with the Brew Potion spell.

Potions may be given to any member of a warband that can carry items & take up 1 item slot each. Otherwise they may be stored in a wizard’s vault or sold.

**Bottle of Burrowing**  
A fig that drinks this potion may use any remaining actions in the activation to move directly through terrain. The fig may not end its activation inside terrain, so must have enough movement to make it completely through the terrain piece.

**Bottle of Darkness**  
If a fig shatters this bottle on the ground, an unnatural darkness immediately falls upon the battlefield. Line-of-sight for everyone is reduced to 12inch for the rest of the game.

**Bottle of Dreams & Nightmares**  
This potion can only be used by a wizard immediately before a game. The wizard should immediately make a Will Roll (TN12). If successful, then the wizard gains an extra 50xp after the game. This does not count towards the 300xp max in a game. If unsuccessful, the wizard has 30xp deducted from those earned during the game (this cannot take the total XP gained for the game below 0). These 30xp are deducted from the max that can be earned (meaning a wizard that fails can earn a max of 270xp in the game).

**Bottle of Null**  
If a fig opens this bottle, all spells in play are immediately cancelled. This will not unsummon creatures, but it will cancel Control spells, including the *Control Demon* spell inherent in *Summon Demon*. Furthermore, all casters must make a Will Roll (TN14) or suffer 1 damage.

**Construct Oil**  
After any game, a wizard may use this magic oil on 1 construct in their warband, giving it a permanent +1 to its Move stat. Each construct may only ever receive the benefit of construct oil once.

**Cordial of Clearsight**  
A fig that drinks this potion ignores the effects of Beauty and Invisibility spells for the rest of the game. Furthermore, if this fig moves into combat with an Illusionary Soldier, the Illusionary Soldier is immediately removed from the table.

**Cordial of Empowerment**  
The next time a fig casts a spell after drinking this potion, they add +4 to their Casting Roll but suffer 2 damage, in addition to any other effects of casting the spell. A caster may only use 1 cordial of empowerment per game. This potion may not be used to cast Out of Game spells.

**Elixir of Life**  
This is the rarest & most valuable of all potions. It can never be bought & only a desperate fool would ever sell it. It may be used immediately after any game. If used, 1 figure that died during that game is brought back to life. The fig suffers no ill effects from death & may take part in the next game.

**Elixir of Speed**
The fig who drinks this potion receives +2 Move for the rest of the game. This may not take a fig’s Move above 9.

**Elixir of the Chameleon**  
This potion allows a fig to blend in with their surroundings. No other figure may draw line-of-sight to this fig if they are more than 12inch away. Thus this fig may only be targeted by an attack or a spell from another fig that is within 12inch.

Ethereal Vacuum  
When a character spends an action to open this bottle, all creatures with the Ethereal trait within 8inch must make a Will Roll (TN20). If they fail, they're sucked into the bottle & imprisoned. Immediately remove the fig from the table & award any XP that would have been earned for killing such a creature.

**Explosive Cocktail**  
Throwing this cocktail follows all the rules of casting the Grenade spell, except that it can be used by a non-caster, no Casting Roll is necessary, & the target point must be within 8inch. Use of this potion cannot replace a move action.

**Philtre of Fairy Dust**  
If this dust is sprinkled over a weapon, the weapon counts as a magic weapon for the rest of the game. It may be sprinkled over an arrow or crossbow bolt, though these will be 1-use items.

**Philtre of Fury**  
The fig gains +1 Fight & receives an additional +1 damage mod on any successful hand-to-hand attack. However the fig must, if possible, use all its actions every turn to move into combat with & fight the closest enemy figure (including uncontrolled creatures) in line-of-sight & not currently in combat.

**Poison**  
This sticky poison may be used to coat any weapon except a staff, bow, or crossbow. It can be used on 1 arrow or crossbow bolt. The next time this weapon causes damage, the fig that takes the damage is poisoned (assuming that fig is not immune to poison). The weapon loses the ability to poison after the first attack with it that causes damage. This potion is not magic & not affected by anything that cancels magic.

**Potion of Elemental Absorption**  
A fig that drinks this potion ignores the next 5 elemental damage it takes.

**Potion of Fire Breath**  
A fig that drinks this potion and still has an action remaining in the same activation, may use that action to make a +3 elemental magic shooting attack at a fig within 6inch.  

**Potion of Healing**  
This potion restores up to 5 lost points of Health. It may not take a fig above its normal starting Health.  

**Potion of Invisibility**  
A fig that drinks this potion is treated as though an Invisibility spell was cast upon it.  

**Potion of Invulnerability**  
A fig that drinks this potion is immune to damage from non-magic weapons. Whenever this fig activates, roll d20. On 17+, the effects of the potion end immediately.

**Potion of Iron Mind**  
A fig that drinks this potion gains +5 Will for the rest of the game.  

**Potion of Preservation**  
This potion may be used on any fig, other than a wizard, who died in the previous game. This potion perfectly preserves the body of the fig for the next 5 games. After each of the next 5 games, a wizard may use an elixir of life potion or a Miraculous Cure spell on the preserved figure. While a fig is preserved, it doesn't count as a member of the warband for the purpose of calculating max warband size, but will do so if brought back to life. A wizard may not hire another apprentice if they have 1 preserved. If after the 5th game, the preserved fig has not been brought back to life it's dead, & should be removed from the Wizard Sheet.  

**Potion of Restoration**  
A fig that drinks this potion is immediately restored to its starting Health & cured of any poison or temporary stat reductions. This potion may also be used after a game to cure the figure of any permanent injuries.  

**Potion of Strength**  
A fig that drinks this potion receives +1 Fight for the rest of the game.  

**Potion of Teleportation**  
A fig that drinks this potion is treated as though it had just cast the Teleport spell.

**Potion of Toughness**  
The fig that drinks this potion receives +1 Armor for the rest of the game.

**Shatterstar Draught**  
If a fig drinks this potion, & then casts a spell during the same activation, then the fig may attempt to cast that spell twice. The attempts should be made 1 after another. Each attempt may have a separate target, both of which must be declared before any rolls are made.  

**Shrinking Potion**  
A fig carrying treasure may use the potion to shrink it down to a size that will fit in a pocket. This fig no longer suffers any penalties to Move, Fight, or Swim for carrying this treasure. It may even carry a second treasure token. If the effect of this potion is cancelled while the figure is carrying 2 treasures, it must choose 1 and immediately drop it. If the shrunk treasure is dropped for any reason, it returns to its normal size.

***Scrolls & Grimoires***

**Scrolls**  
The number in brackets indicates how many scrolls are found. For each scroll, roll once on the **Random Spell Table** to determine what spell it is. As scrolls only contain magic spells written in shorthand, they can't be used to learn a new spell. Scrolls take up 1 item slot. Otherwise they may be sold for 30gc or stored in the wizard’s vault.

GRIMOIRES  
Grimoires may be actual books, piles of scrolls, stone tablets, or whatever; the exact nature of a grimoire is not important. What is important is that a wizard can use a grimoire to learn a spell they don’t know. Whenever a grimoire is found, roll on the **Random Spell Table** to identify the spell it contains. A grimoire is stored in the wizard’s vault until such a time as the wizard wants to learn the spell within (see Experience and Level) or to sell it. Once a grimoire’s spell has been learned, the book loses its value, & should be removed from the Wizard Sheet.  

A wizard would never willingly part with a grimoire that contains a spell they don't know. If a wizard obtains a grimoire containing a spell they already know, they may sell it for 200gc.

***Magic Weapons and Armor***  
For every result of Magic Weapon/Armor on the Treasure Table, the player should roll once on the Magic Weapon and Armor Table.

Magic weapons that give a bonus to damage do so on top of any damage modifier offered by the basic version of the weapon. For example, a magic crossbow that grants a +1 damage modifier would, in effect, deal +3 damage with a successful strike (+2 for a crossbow, +1 for the magic effect); a magic dagger with a +2 damage modifier would deal +1 damage with a hit (-1 for a dagger, +2 for the magic effect).

A figure may only carry one of each type of magic weapon or armor at any time, so only 1 hand weapon, one bow, one shield etc. All magic weapons & armor take up the same number of item slots as the mundane version. Note that the first dagger carried by a figure does not take up an item slot, so it is possible for a soldier to carry a magic dagger and one other item. Magic weapons and armor may only be carried by soldiers who already carried a weapon or armor of that type (e.g. a thief cannot carry a magic hand weapon, but a thug can). In this case, the magic weapon both replaces the mundane version & takes up an item slot. In the case of two-handed weapons, that normally take 2 slots, a soldier can carry one of these even if they normally only have one item slot. Casters carry any weapon, but can't wear armor or carry shields.

Magic weapons and armor can be stored in the wizard’s vault and assigned to a specific figure between games. Between games, a player can move any magic weapons and armor between any figures who are able to use them. Any time a figure armed with a magic weapon makes an attack, it is considered to be a magic attack. The exception is bows and crossbows. Shooting attacks with these weapons are not considered magic attacks unless a magic arrow or bolt is used.

A figure may only receive the benefits of one magic weapon at a time. So, if they are carrying more than one, they must choose which one to use in any given situation.

If a figure is wearing an item with Elemental Absorption, then any elemental damage they take (such as from the Elemental Bolt or Elemental Ball spells) is halved, rounding up.

This table also lists the **purchase price** for which a wizard may buy a specific weapon or piece of armor, and the sale price for which a wizard can sell an unwanted one.

If cast on a bow or crossbow it only applies to the next attack.

###### Elemental Shield
***Elementalist / 10 / Self-Only***

###### Absorb Knowledge

If any fig that was not part of the caster’s warband at the start of the game moves within 1inch of the rune, it explodes & every fig within 2inch suffers an immediate +5 magic attack. Note that if the rune is placed within 1inch of a fig, it does not immediately explode -- that fig must move to set it off. A caster can have up to 3 such runes in play at a time. At the end of any turn, they may choose to cancel any or all their runes.

If this pushes the target into the edge of the table or a piece of terrain over 0.5inch high, they stop immediately. Other figs don't stop (or get hit by) a pushed fig -- they're assumed to dodge. If this spell is cast from beneath a fig it pushes them up. If the target is pushed up or off a height, it suffers falling damage as normal. You can push a fig out of combat, & as it's not a shooting attack, the target is not randomized.

###### Write Scrolls

A fig under Mind Control can't purposely take any action that causes it immediate damage, but can be moved into combat & can attack an enemy fig.

A Nat1 summons an uncontrolled demon; place the demon in combat with the caster. Roll d20 to determine type of demon:

Place a line of fog 1x6inch & 3inch high anywhere on table as long as some part is within line-of-sight & all within 24inch. Figs can move through with no penalty, but line-of-sight is obscured. At start of each turn, roll d20: on 1-4 fog dissipates & removed from table.

###### Mud
***Witch / 10 / Line-of-Sight***  
All ground within 3inch of a target point becomes Rough Ground.

###### Poison Dart
***Witch / 10 / Line-of-Sight***  
Make an immediate +3 poison shooting attack vs target fig. This is a non-magic attack.
