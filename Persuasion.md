# Persuasion

Rhetoric is the art of persuasion, and aims to study the techniques speakers utilize to inform, persuade, or motivate particular audiences in specific situations.

**Persuasion** is the process of guiding oneself or another toward the adoption of an attitude by rational or symbolic means. Six "weapons of influence" can contribute to an individual's propensity to be influenced by a persuader:
- Reciprocity: People desire to return favors.
- Commitment and consistency: People are uncomfortable when self-contradictory. Once they commit to an idea or behavior, they are averse to changing their minds without good reason.
- Social proof: People will be more open to things that they see others doing.
- Authority: People tend to obey figures of authority, game, or expertise.
- Liking: People are more easily swayed by others they like or they wish liked them.
- Scarcity: A perceived limitation of resources will generate demand. If someone has already committed themselves to something, then find out they cannot have it, it makes the person want the item more.

**Conformity** is a type of social influence involving a change in behavior, belief, or thinking to align with those of others or with normative standards. It is the most common and pervasive form of social influence. Social psychology research in conformity tends to distinguish between two varieties:
- **Informational conformity** (also: Social proof, herd behaviour) is considered prominent in ambiguous social situations where people are unable to determine the appropriate _mode of behavior_, and is driven by the assumption that the surrounding people possess more knowledge about the current situation.
- **Normative social influence** involves a change in behaviour that is deemed necessary in order to fit in a particular group. The need for a positive relationship with the people around leads us to conformity. This fact often leads to people exhibiting public compliance of the group's social norms in order to be accepted.

**Compliance** is when people appear to agree with others but actually keep their dissenting opinions private.

**Identification** is when people are influenced by someone who is liked and respected, such as a famous celebrity or love interest.

**Internalization** is when people accept a belief or behavior and agree both publicly and privately.

Persuasion can occur through appeals to reason or appeals to emotion.

###### The Appeals of Argument
Arguments have a balance of all of 4, though emotion is essential for a strong argument. However, appeals can also be misused, creating arguments that are not credible. 

**Logical (logos) appeal** is the strategic use of logic, claims, and evidence to convince an audience of a certain point. It focuses on "the message".
When used correctly, logical appeal contains the following elements... 
- Strong clear claims 
- Reasonable qualifiers for claims 
- Warrants that are valid 
- Clear reasons for claims 
- Strong evidence (facts, stats, personal experience, expert authority, interviews, observations, anecdotes) 
- Acknowledgement of opposition 
 
When used poorly, logical appeals may include... 
- Over-generalized claims 
- Reasons that are not fully explained or supported 
- Logical fallacies 
- Evidence misused or ignored 
- No recognition of opposing views 

**Ethical (ethos) appeal** is used to establish the speaker as fair, open-minded, honest, and knowledgeable. Creates a sense trustworthiness and credibility. 
- Focuses attention on the speaker’s trustworthiness.
- Takes one of two forms: “appeal to character” or “appeal to credibility.” 
- Speakers show “ethos” through tone, such as taking care to show more than one side of an issue before arguing for their side. When you use a counterargument to show an opposing side to an issue before explaining why your thesis is still correct, you use ethos.
- Other times, the speaker may rely on their reputation for honesty or experience in a particular field. Advertising that relies on doctors’ statements or political records use an appeal to ethos.

When used correctly, the speaker is seen as... 
- Well-informed
- Confident
- Sincere and honest 
- Understanding of the audience's concerns and possible objections 
- Humane and considerate 
 
When used incorrectly, the speaker can be viewed as...
- Unfair or dishonest 
- Distorting or misrepresenting information (biased) 
- Insulting or dismissive of other viewpoints 
- Advocating intolerant ideas 
 
**Kairos** (“right time,” “season” or “opportunity”)
- Refers to the “timeliness” of an argument, and tailoring your argument to your audience
- Often, for an argument to be successful, it needs appropriate tone and structure and to come at the right time.
- Kairos is also the reason you might send a different kind of complaint email to your boss than you would to your mom or to a close friend. You may want similar results from all three of these recipients, but depending on who will read it, you may adjust the timing, tone and level of formality within the email itself.

**Emotional (pathos) appeal** targets the emotions and imagination of an audience to create some kind of connection with the speaker. Since humans are in many ways very emotional creatures, pathos can be an extremely potent strategy in argument. For this same reason however, emotional appeal is often misused... sometimes to intentionally mislead listeners or to hide an argument that is logically  weak. A lot of visual appeal is emotional in nature (think of advertisements, with their powerful imagery, colors, fonts, and symbols). 
- Focuses attention on the values and beliefs of the audience.
- Appeals to the audience’s capacity for empathy, often by using an imaginable story to exemplify logical appeals.
- Whereas logos and ethos appeal to our mental capacities for logic, pathos appeals to our imaginations and feelings, helping the audience grasp an argument’s significance in terms of how it would help or harm the tangible world around them specifically.

When done well, emotional appeals... 
- Reinforce logical arguments 
- Use diction and imagery to create a bond with the audience in a human way 
- Appeal to idealism, beauty, humor, nostalgia, or pity (or other emotions) in a balanced way 
- Are presented in a fair manner 
 
When used improperly, emotional appeals... 
- Become a substitute for logic and reason (TV and magazine advertising often relies heavily on emotional rather than logical appeal) 
- Uses stereotypes to pit one group of people against another (propaganda and political advertising does this) 
- Offers oversimplified, unthinking reaction to a complex problem 
- Takes advantage of emotions to manipulate (through fear, hate, pity, prejudice, embarrassment, lust, or other feelings) rather than convince credibly 
 
**Appeal to emotion** or passion is an informal fallacy characterized by the manipulation of the recipient's emotions in order to win an argument, especially in the absence of factual evidence. This kind of appeal to emotion is a type of red herring and encompasses several logical fallacies, including appeals to...
- consequences, 
- fear
- flattery
- pity
- ridicule
- spite
- wishful thinking
The appeal to emotion is only fallacious when the emotions that are elicited are irrelevant to evaluating the truth of the conclusion and serve to distract from rational consideration of relevant premises or information.
