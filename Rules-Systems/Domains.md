# Domains

Domain Level Play

Material Resources:
- gold > from ore
- brick > from clay
- lumber > from wood
- food > from fish
- leather > from hides

Social Resources:
- Renown

Every turn you receive numbers of material resources.
Using resources requires a roll under of that resource, success allows you to use however many you want, failure means you can only use 1 unless that would leave you with zero.
