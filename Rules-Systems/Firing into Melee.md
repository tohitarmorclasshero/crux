Firing Into Melee

If an attack misses the intended target, there’s a 1in2 chance it hits an ally engaged in the melee. Determine that ally randomly, then re-roll the attack against the ally’s AC.

This could also be expressed as disadvantage, with the attack only succeeding against the intended target if both are successes, while only 1 success indicating friendly-fire; in this case, use the higher of the two rolls against your ally’s AC.
