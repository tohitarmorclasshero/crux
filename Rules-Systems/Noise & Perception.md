# Noise & Perception
Noise & Perception
Roll a d20 every 10 minutes (basically every room)

d20
1-2 | random encounter with a monster or NPC
3-4 | clues to what's on the wandering monster table
5+ | nothing special

When you're dungeon crawling, your party has stats the same way that your characters have stats.
Two of the stats that your party has are called Noise & Perception. The default party has Noise 2 and Perception 2.
Noise corresponds to how noticeable your party is being as they walk through the dungeon. It correlates with rolling 1-2 on the wandering monster check. i.e. "You are noticed".
Perception corresponds to how well your party does at noticing the other folks who are walking through the dungeon. It correlates with rolling a 3-4 on the wandering monster check. i.e. "You notice other people".

The following things modify your party stats.
- Each encumbered character. +1 Noise.
- Each large animal traveling with the party. +1 Noise.
- Each ranger in the party. +1 Perception.

If a party has a donkey, an encumbered rogue, and a ranger, the party has Noise 4 and Perception 3. The ranges of the 2 results on the wandering monster check should change to reflect that. Ergo:

d20
1-4 | random encounter
5-7 | notice others
8+ | nothing special
