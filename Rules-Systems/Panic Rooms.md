# Panic Rooms
PANIC ROOMS  
  
On very rare occasions dungeon delvers may discover a refuge from the terrors of the Underworld in a remote corner of the dungeon. Often tucked behind hidden doors, easily fortified and with only a single entrance, these rooms act as a place for PCs to rest long enough to regather their strength. The party is required to determine on their own what constitutes a panic room, with harsh consequences for failure, namely the Dungeons &amp; Dawn Patrol table (from Jeff Rients).  
  
At the end of the session the party must rest in the panic room if they are still in the dungeon. They can do this for a single long rest. However, these places are only 'safe' in comparison to the rest of the dungeon hell that surrounds them and should be used only in the most desperate of circumstances. Avoiding wandering monsters requires that the party hide in total darkness and absolute silence. Despite these precautions, players are still likely to periodically hear a variety of sounds outside the door, from growling and heavy breathing to loud crashes as the more stubborn predators attempt to force their way in.  
  
Following this harrowing experience players roll for their hit points twice (as per the Living it Up rule), take the lower value and then dive that in half. It's highly suggested that players beat a hasty retreat to the surface, if able. If, for whatever reason, the party does not return to the surface they must utilize a different panic room or roll on the Dungeons &amp; Dawn Patrol table as their original hiding spot is effectively 'blown' and will remain so for 2d6 weeks. Furthermore, spending more than one night in a dungeon is really pushing your luck. On the second night there is a 2in6 chance of disaster despite being in a panic room. Roll on the following Couchsurfing in the Dungeon table:

Table: Panic Rooms

01

Assault on Dungeon 13: The monsters know you're in there, and by gods, they're getting in. Roll wandering monsters 1d6+2 times; the lot of them are on the other side of the door and are actively trying to kick it in.

02

Troll Toll: Randomly choose 1 intelligent monster from a nearby level, preferably an organized group of some kind. They've entrenched outside your panic room and demand that all magic treasures be turned over immediately.

03

Door To The Netherworld: A secret door has materialized in your panic room. Roll 1d6 to determine how many floors down it connects to. The wandering monster from that level about to break in on the players has a 4in6 chance of surprise.

04

One of Us! One of Us!: The dungeon has claimed you as its own. Doors open for you automatically and you can see in the dark. Unfortunately, it may not be so easy to leave. As the party nears the entrance each PC must make a Fortitude save. Failure indicates the character cannot go any further, as if blocked by a <i>Wall of Force</i>. Those who pass their save find that they are free to go. Party members left behind must save versus death each night or transform into a monster (this is a form of Curse).

05+

All's Quiet: Nothing happens.

Each night spent in the dungeon after the second increases the chance of disaster, increasing the chance of mishap by 1 per day (3in6, 4in6, etc).
