#### Conditions (Pathfinder 2)

**Enfeebled**: -5 to all Str rolls.
**Clumsy**: -5 to all Dex rolls.
**Maimed**: -5 to all Con rolls.
**Stunned**: -5 to all Int rolls.
**Stupefied**: -5 to all Wis rolls.
**Drained**: -5 to all Cha rolls.

**Blinded**: All terrain is difficult terrain. You automatically CritFail all Perception checks & Initiative. You're immune to visual effects. Blinded overrides Dazzled.

**Confused**: You don't treat anyone as your ally, & you can't can't Delay, Ready, or use Reactions. You use all your actions to Strike or cast offensive cantrips, though the DM can have you use other actions to facilitate attack, such as drawing a weapon, moving into attack range, & so forth. Your targets are determined randomly. If you have no viable targets, you target yourself -- you hit automatically but can't crit. If it's impossible to attack or cast spells, you babble incoherently, wasting your actions. Any time you take damage from an attack or spell you can make a DC11Charisma check to regain your senses.

**Controlled**: Someone else is making your decisions for you, usually via some magical command or domination. The controller dictates how you act & can make you use any of your actions, including attacks, reactions, or even Delay. The controller has to spend their own actions when controlling you.

**Dazzled**: Your eyes are overstimulated. All other creatures are concealed from you.

**Deafened**: You automatically CritFail Perception checks & Initiative. If you perform an action that requires some kind of auditory component you do so with -DisAdv. You are immune to auditory effects.

**Doomed**: A powerful force has gripped your spirit, calling you closer to death. You take a -5 penalty to Death saves.

**Encumbered**: Gain the Clumsy condition, & reduce your Spd-10 (min5).

**Fascinated**: You CritFail Perception checks & can't use Concentration actions. This condition automatically ends if a creature takes a hostile action against you.

**Fatigued**: While exploring, you can't choose an Exploration activity.

### Stress (Van Richtens)
Charging headlong into terrifying situations is the stock in trade for adventurers. Among the Domains of Dread though, periods of respite between harrowing experiences can be rare. Even the hardiest adventurers find themselves worn down over time, their performance suffering as they struggle to cope with the dread & despair.
Various circumstances might cause a character stress. Stress can be tracked numerically as a Stress score, increasing in trying situations & decreasing with care. At your discretion, a character's Stress score might increase by 1 when 1 of the following situations occurs:
* Every 24hours the character goes without finishing a long rest.
* Witnessing the death of a loved one.
* A nightmare or darkest fear made real.
* Shattering the character's fundamental understanding of reality.
* Witnessing a person transform into a horrid or unnatural creature.
* An enemy demonstrates it can deal enough damage to reduce a character to zero HP in 1 blow.

When a character wakes from sleep they apply their Stress score immediately as a penalty to their HP. Characters also apply their Stress score as a penalty on rolls to resist Conditions.
A character who spends an entire day relaxing or in otherwise calm circumstances reduces their Stress score by their ProfBonus when they finish their next long rest.
Calm Emotions also suppresses the effects of Stress score for the spell's duration.
Lesser Restoration reduces the target's Stress score by 1, & Greater Restoration reduces a character's Stress score to zero.
