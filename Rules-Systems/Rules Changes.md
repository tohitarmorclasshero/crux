# Rules Changes
1in6 = 15% = 3in20
2in6 = 35% = 7in20
3in6 = 50% = 10in20
4in6 = 65% = 13in20
5in6 = 85% = 17in20

Jade Hell: the forest is wooden and fungal and full of decay, the only light below the canopy is phosphorous and comes from certain fungal growths

The World Tree: is a mycelial network that connects all space/time

Undead: lesser undead can't see someone if they're holding their breath, you can't be mind-read if you close your eyes.

Damage = ability modifier + static weapon bonus + magic bonus, +2 damage with crit

Ringwraiths are mummies, they have fire vulnerability, infecting frodo with their attack was clearly mummy rot

No more than 1 main attack per turn. Subsequent attacks convert to advantage

Critical Hits
Crit results in dealing +2 damage, & a free bonus strike. Characters can normally only make 1 strike per turn.

Clarke Gerkin: business casual bugbear crime boss of tracksuit mafia.

The Great Rat: cargo cult among ratmen that holds up the rat with mythological invulnerability, like "cockroaches can survive a nuke" type veneration; being weak ratmen worship strength and what's stronger than invincible?

magic missile can easily replace flurry of blows
monks are just casters that cast their spells at max spell level by spending 1/ki point (hit point) per spell level.

hit points can be spent to make up the difference in any roll, either confirmation (action check) or effect (damage)

folding paper pop-up dice tower

divide skills into categories defined by the 3 pillars of d&d

goblins almost never have intact ears, noses, or hair

(verb + noun + place) generator learning algorithm

dwarfs are -80% the height of humans, and +80% heavier
cube of the 4/5ths height difference between dwarf & human

Raiment of Daggers rogue ability ?

any time a class has a spendable resource it comes from HP, unless it acts like a Fate Point binary trade mechanic

Assuming anything can be done with care by a layman in 2 hours, we then assume that when you try to do something fast than that, it incurs a penalty to perception and thus accidents/hazards happen in your immediacy, unless you're particularly skilled in which case you reduce this penalty

a six spoke wheel (trivial pursuit circle), 2 blue, 2 red, separated by yellow at top, and green at bottom, yin-yang analogue

mount doom is the primordial fire, the time before time where the universe was but energy and heat, thus anything made inside this time-mote of the beginning time cannot be destroyed because it was created inside a fixed point in time. the ring exists in both the world beyond and within the fixed point, quantum-locked invulnerability

ulfire is infrared, jale is ultraviolet
for creatures with expanded vision, the color gammit expands such that normal-vision colors receed into white as color bands are remapped onto previously unseen light wavelengths; this means regular bright light would become blinding for purposes of seeing with darkvision (i.e. normal light ruins your darkvision)

darkvision doubles dim-light range, but not bright-light range, areas of bright light become blinding-light while using darkvision

the one ring turns you invisible and can take a free move in place of an action; any time you make a roll of any kind the enemy can see you, rolling a 1 causes the ring to try betraying you, the ring staves off aging because it uses time manipulation to speed up your baryonic frequency, i.e. molecular phase shifting, note that you cannot pass through matter because regular matter is longer wavelength and more powerful; this is what ethereal means, phase-shifted into higher frequency; you would experience light becoming more like time-stopped rain and be able to see the tails of light particles this would probably be pretty dim-light; the reverse of this makes you fall through the floor/ground (hope there's an unoccupied space there!, otherwise splat), 

jump checks are really "ignore-obstacle-&-move-normally-without-hurting-myself" checks

sloth = the silent majority, failing to speak truth to power, failure to correct injustice, social-laziness, not living up to expectations, the family failure, 

big-fish-tales are the sport of humans

dwarfs do honor stuff klingon-strong

Ork = the Blight from dragon age, a magical hive mind fungal infection, each clan subject to their own variant infection -- each with their own alliances and enmities; is this nanite-AI mind control? or demon-lord cult beastmaster berserker rage voodoo zombie warrior? mind-control ear-worms of Kyuss?
Kobold = skaven
Bugbear = jack pumpkinhead, living construct root vegetables from Labyrinth or Return to Oz
Goblin1 = kenku/flightless-owlin/strix marimbra
Goblin2 = lord of the flies cannibal halflings, created by hags
Ogre = hag-ruined children, force-fed fois-gras-style, pitiful, 
Fetch = monster that replaces children stolen from their cribs, 
Gentry = treat children as money, the younger the better; do the Gentry fear blood? period blood? or is it hormones? the Gentry are the mad remnants of the Aeldari Dominance/Dominion (the Elf Kingdom). once the kingdom fell they used their considerable magic powers to shore up and maintain a semblance of their previous power/lives and eventually went mad as they waited for reinforcements that never came as they tumbled into obsession and depravity.
Hags = part of the Gentry, the Dark Eldar, eat children, revel in pain, create fey-mist to entrap prey and steal children, the mist is sentient and malevolent
Goliath = human amazons
Halfling = urbanite
Dwarf/gnome/human/human = different castes of dwarves; warrior/artisan/merchant/servant
Dragonborn = their wars are fought in dragon-dreams, their breath can be used to make dragonglass, their city Zir is spun dragonglass
Dragonglass = as steel weapons, can only be repaired by master dragonsmiths
Bael Turath = the cities of tieflings, and mutants, 7 cities of hell
Warforged = cyber-knights, treat their unarmored self as their useless unleveled npc sidekick
Spellfire = from Faerun?
Cult of the Dragon = 


The Bear Empire (blue), The Lion Empire (yellow), The Horse Empire (brown), The Elephant Empire (green), and the Eagle Empire (red)

- exigency - zipperon
- 4 types of narrative - zipperon
- don't narrate the players turn, narrate the transitions between turns - zipperon
- what ARE you doing?, NOT what do you do...
- continuous vs continual - zipperon
- tension comes from uncertainty - zipperon

- monsters don't have hp, they just have "hits" - profDM+me (hits have a damage threshold 5/10/15), example: AC15, 5dmg OO/OO (slash=bloody threshold) -> this AC is medium, any damage over 3 counts as a "hit" followed by hitboxes divided into 2 groups by a slash which is the bloody threshold

- fellacious magic vs sympathetic magic - zipperon (magical thinking makes absolute sense in a magical world where magic actually exists, whether its true or not)

- over time magic changes, such that spells that worked in ancient times don't anymore, and new spell techniques become viable as magic changes, allowing for the development of new spells even when those same techniques didn't use to work - tekumel

save or die
makes you go straight to death saves if you're already below bloodied condition. if you're above bloodied, it makes you roll; success makes you bloodied

save or die - zipperon disney
make appropriate save
success: hp loss
fail: hp loss & become bloodied or crippled, if bloodied go to zero hp

bloodied condition
?the CON crippled condition?
?since CON saves basically never happen, maybe?
bloodied happens when you have 1/2 or less than your normal hp

crippled condition
if you're already bloodied and gain bloodied again you instead gain crippled
1 per stat, makes you roll at -5 (?shoulditbe -DisAdv?)

shields shall be splintered
when a player would take damage, they can sacrifice a thematically related item to avoid it; ex: take a crippled condition against any situation, shields or weapons for weapon or spell attacks, adventure gear for exploration hazards, wands or staffs against spells, etc.

item decay
every time the players long rest, players roll d20 and choose the indicated item slot and that item is either decayed or broken

crit fumbles (rolling 1)
cause an item to break or decay, or take a crippled condition

crit success (rolling 20)
gives inspiration

mighty deeds - bobworldbuilder

skill challenges - dungeoncoach/colville

No more than 1 main attack per turn. Subsequent attacks convert to advantage.

Evil 1: corruption of intellect

Str, dex, con, int, Wis, Cha = Str, reflex, resolve, cunning, magic, cha

Nagas = ancient god(dragon?) larva ?

Dragonbreath is purely magical, not biophysical at all. Not sure if this means they're conduits for elemental planes or not...

Mighty deeds for fighters as bonus action.

Bonus actions are "riders" on triggering actions, they aren't their own thing. You can't "take" a bonus action, you get it as a result of a triggering action. Like a reaction to your own action.

Ganging-up instead of flanking…
Flanking gives attack bonus +2 for every doubling of flanking foes
Flanking gives AC penalty, not attack bonus. -1 per flanker

Disarm automatically means you kick the object away or pick it up yourself because you can interact with an object/feature as part of your turn for free (PHB190)

Ghost sea =?= Outer space, double check necromancer spacejammer from i think zaks blog...

"Mannus Ajaxus" republican Rome run by wizards, eventually taken over by Ajax the conqueror (Julius Caesar -type) after a period of warlord dictatorships

Race has hit dice too

Spells use hit points not spell points, 1st=1, 2nd=1d4, 3rd=1d6, 4th=1d8, 5th=1d10, 6th=1d12, etc.

If only going to level 10, that means 5thlvl+ spells are off the table. Spell points also make this a little weird. Maybe have casters only able to cast spells of level= profbonus, anything else functions either as ritual(safe) or like spellscroll special rule (risky). Maybe roll proficiency dice vs spell level to cast on fly.

Sorcerers specialize in bleeding edge unstable spells = wonder& wickedness

Druids specialize in transmuting

The Wise is the base class for all spellcasters, your path choice at 3rd level is then between wizard, druid, cleric, sorcerer, etc.

Goodberry consumes it's material component

Paladin = marshal, their spells are "moves" like monks/book of 9 swords

Paladins and monks have a lot of thematic crossover... Smites are like flurries... 

World Above, space, where all light has been (greedily) sheparded/converted into the sun Azoth/Zulin, where individuality is subsumed into the collective order stagnation

World Below: those escaping/opposing Azoth support individualism change evolution surprise

Pillar of Cups: where an ancient godking set about calculating the daylight cycle using monolithic building techniques

Druids use masks,1 per form, infused with a single drop off animal blood of the form they wish to use. They turn into an exact copy of that animal. This is a sort of counting coup. Evil druids use all the blood, and are more powerful.

Long rests can only be taken in sanctuary, short rests only in the wilderness (middle earth 5e)

Should non casters level faster? Should their 20 level progression be compressed to 10?

Grell?

Vargoille

Alkilith is the explanation for random or out of place portals, they can go anywhere/when, they are angels, they are the self healing network of the world superintelligence, they can bend time and space but not directly affect it, they cannot explain how what they do will help because they are executable programs/macros

Intellect devourer should clearly have filaments in the shape of a human nervous system, not animal legs

Flumph stats for octopus slavers?

Oblex is a gelatinous cube, use culture preservation backstory from Goblinpunch

Kuo-toa and slaad are the same thing 

Mindflayers look like worm that walks starspawn

Elves are narratively mindflayers but with more body horror and vivimancy

Skilled on/off (5e hardcore)

Healing Surges: like second wind from star wars saga

Shove aside

Cleaving through creatures

Injuries (not this table tho)

Massive damage

Healing Food Dependency:  Characters can't spend HD during a rest unless they use a ration or healing item.

Where The Machines Wait

Monster initiative = 10+ room level (indexcardrpg)

City Humans= Urbanites

Despair, obsession, deceit, rage

Giants have iron bones, stand 20ish ft tall, and weigh roughly 5000 lbs (skeleton is roughly 15% of bodymass)

"Beastmen" = barbarian goblinoids (goblin, hobgoblin, bugbear)

Eberron Goblins = dwarves

Kobolds = skaven

Aboleth are fine but make them primeval jellyfish and sahuagin/kuo-toa service them as ancient evil gods

Get rid of lizardmen and snakemen, they step on frogfishmens toes too much, replace with mudmen from rolangs creeping doom

50 fates: a deck of cards that portrays your destiny/fate, usually ambiguous and/or terrible

Red wizards of thay, doomvaults from adventure dead in thay

Houses and clans are rated same as lifestyle expenses

Use GameofThronesRPG for ages and Benefits(feats), Destiny=Luck stat

Hp= sum(6 stats) - 10*size

Hp= sum(6 stats) +size -(10x size) +Level

Spirit mango: feeds spirit pets and flavors spells

Snakestone: quite minor amulets, most popular being a charm against malicious gossip

Corpse honey: a miraculous panacea

Palm-leather sampan: a wonderful hat even lighter than a wooden one

Sunfruit: protects against all forms of cold, your skin maintains a harmless healthy warmth as hot as glowing iron

Teak semen: can be used by a woman to summon a teak nymph

Sweet resin/bush lollies: carbs that taste like honey or sweet sap; eaten straight from tree, used like honey drops

Cracker fish: deep fried crackers made of fish and spices

Barbarians are divided into sea nomads, reed people, stilt walkers, treebuilders, and the (fianna) prides

players, just don't.
These cylinders contain samples of The Black. This has been referred to in the
game by a travelling veterinarian the characters met who told them of animals which
were becoming blighted by the black, and what they have here is something similar
to the black oil from the X-Files, though they don't know it. After the events which
occurred in the Scientists' main temple,
the PCs have decided it is something akin to the stuff in Prometheus (which is
close).
End highlight.
So the potential exists for some sort o

Channeling check: like clerics from dcc, magical mishaps and such. Short rest hd can apply to chance instead of hp, long rest resets total. This represents their concentration and discipline eroding over time.
