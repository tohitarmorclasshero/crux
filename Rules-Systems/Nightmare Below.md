# Nightmare Below
From beyond the veil of sleep, inhuman forces invade...

The Fall of Idolatry
Once, the world was ruled by the gods of the idolaters, and chaos reigned over all. Wars never ended, innocents were slaughtered, men and women turned away from their people and went into hiding, only to die in isolation. Great plagues of legend walked, proudly and openly, throughout the land, spreading misery, death, and abomination.
These false gods make harsh demands of their followers, ranking their wills and their vanities as more valuable than human life. To enslave yourself to an inhuman creature is to deny your own humanity. To place an inhuman entity above yourself, between yourself and the world, is to deny your own fundamental connection to yourself and the world, and to your society, which is the prime force for harmony and order in the world.
Those who turn away from their own people, who give their lives to graven idols and demonic creatures from beyond the stars, who live outside the world -- those are the real traitors. To follow only your own heart and deny your responsibilities to others is to support chaos, and the rule of the sword.

The Threat of Chaos
There is a shadow across the land -- or rather, beneath it. Invading nightmares worm their way into the light. Gaping maws of darkness spit terrors into the world, to drag the unwilling down to hells unspeakable. These dungeons beneath the ground are extensions of the nightmare realm. Nightmare incursions can take many forms, but at heart they are the opposite of the sunlit world above: dark, cramped, and claustrophobic, underground lairs, inhabited by inhuman monstrosities created by fear and destruction.

A Darkness From Beyond
But where do these nightmares come from? There is no easy or certain answer, and much of what follows is the hearsay of wizards, who (by definition) have more dealings with otherworldly forces than most. Yet, like most knowledge, such revelations raise more questions than they settle, and it is much easier to catalogue the effects of nightmare incursions than to discern the truths of their origins or the fundamentals of their natures.

Fighter
Skilled at foraging, hunting, laboring, scavenging, soldiering, and keeping their gear in good working order.
* Armor does not count as encumbering for you, as long as you are wearing it (but shields do).
* If you attack an enemy, if your attack is a miss, you still inflict damage equal to your proficiency die (with no chance of crit).

Social Class
3d6 \ Mod \ Social Class
-\-\-
3 \ -3 \ Penniless, nomadic vagrants. Slave laborers. Untouchables.
4-5 \ -2 \ Average servants and slaves. Poor peasants.
6-8 \ -1 \ Most peasants. Poor proletariats. Well-off servants and slaves.
9-12 \ zero \ The middle-classes: city-folk, freemen, merchants, and proletarians.
13-15 \ +1 \ Knights, lesser nobles, successful bankers and merchants, wealthy city-folk. At this rank, you might be called bey, faris, or sheikh, if you have a legitimate leadership position.
16-17 \ +2 \ Barons, counts, dukes, and other nobles. At this rank you may style yourself a pasha or even khan.
18 \ +3 \ Royalty and greater nobility. The possibility of becoming a shah or sultan exists, though remains unlikely. At this rank, you may be addressed as emir, even if you are not a leader or commander.

Use your social class modifier in place of your Charisma mod for initial reaction rolls and first impressions. For subsequent reaction rolls, or reaction rolls by people who already know who you are, use your Charisma as normal. You may also use your social class mod instead of your Charisma mod when communicating by letter with government officials or bureaucratic bodies.
Anyone who ends up with a social class roll of 13 or higher may choose to take any 1 item or piece of equipment as a family heirloom they have inherited. They do not have to pay for these heirlooms.

Motives
When a person dies inside an incursion, the nightmares strip their mind and soul of all their fear, pain, and terror in order to make new dungeons from them. This is why the Judge needs to know what drives your character into these incursions, and perhaps something about their past. Detailing your character's history and life outside of adventuring can also make your interactions in civilized areas richer and more interesting.
Choose 1 or roll randomly, then decide on the specific details. Alternatively, use these as a template to create your own motivation.

d20 \ Motivations
-\-
1 \ You are driven by costly vices (addiction, gambling, etc.)
2 \ You are hated by other members of your profession.
3 \ You are a known criminal.
4 \ You're an outsider here, exiled from your home.
5 \ You are part of an ostracized minority, so work is not offered to you.
6 \ You have been too traumatized by violence.
7 \ You have no profitable skills other than adventuring.
8 \ You have religious objections to work.
9 \ You lack the discipline employers desire.
10 \ Your compulsive behaviors prevent you from staying employed.
11 \ Because you believe the world is at stake.
12 \ Because you can't handle any other life.
13 \ Because you have debts to pay off.
14 \ Because you made an oath or promise to do so.
15 \ In order to bury or uncover a family secret.
16 \ In order to find someone who, or something that, has disappeared.
17 \ In order to free yourself from a curse or something that haunts you.
18 \ In order to gain absolution or forgiveness for crimes you may have committed.
19 \ In order to get revenge on someone or something that wronged you.
20 \ In order to learn more about a supernatural experience in your past.

Running Out of Money
Characters with no money and no home must go adventuring immediately or take out a loan. The alternative is to go without food, which means that you can't reroll your Health, and you will eventually die of starvation. Meanwhile, loans accrue interest every month -- or every week -- and moneylenders don't last long if they don't send goons after those who don't pay their debts. You don't have to stay broke though. There's always another dungeon full of nightmares to fight.

Hauling Stuff Around
Items that must be strapped to your body or carried in hand are regular encumbering items. Items that take 2 or more hands or are awkward are large encumbering items. You can probably only carry 1 awkward item at a time, and they might count as 2 or even 3 encumbering items each. You may carry a number of encumbering items equal to your current HP without penalty. Carrying additional items means you are encumbered.
Anything you can fit in a pocket is a small item. If your group wants to track small items, you can carry a number of small items equal to half your current HP (rounded down), in addition to any encumbering items you are carrying, provided you have some means to do so (like enough pockets or a backpack). Carrying more than that means you are encumbered.
In the equipment lists, an L denotes a large encumbering item, an S is a small item. A number means the item takes up several encumbrance slots. Any item with a dash instead of a letter or number is always an oversized item, too large to be carried around easily.

Armor
It is usually a good idea to protect yourself from being murdered. Armor is 1 way to do that, although it should be noted that you can't dodge while wearing heavy armor. A suit of plate always counts as heavy armor, but is more encumbering.

Armor Type \ Rating \ Cost \ Encumbrance
-\-\-\-
Heavy armor \ 15 \ 100 \ 3
Helmet \ -- \ 10 \ 0
Light armor \ 10 \ 25 \ 1
Shield \ +1 \ 15 \ 1
Suit of plate \ 17 \ 1500 \ 4
Tower shield \ +2 \ 50 \ 2
Unarmored \ 5 \ nothing \ --
- *If you are a fighter, your armor doesn't encumber you, though a shield still does.
- ** Being mounted or on higher ground also gives you +1 Armor from the ground.

Barding Type \ Rating \ Cost \ Encumbrance
-\-\-\-
Heavy \ +4 \ 500 \ 4
Light \ +2 \ 250 \ 2
Plate \ +6 \ 2000 \ 6
- * Dogs naturally have Armor 13.
- ** Only an animal trained for war can wear heavy or plate barding.

 2-handed weapons are Large
Daggers, garrottes, and whips are Small
Heavy crossbows are 2 encumbrance
Javelins are Small.
Longbows and Rifles are Large.
Throwing axes and blades are Small.

Tools
A set of tools contains up to a half-dozen distinct, portable, and useful items for practicing a profession. Each tool can be a small, hand-sized implement (like a chisel ro a trowel), or a collection of tiny ones (needles or pencils, for example). You may describe the actual tools whenever you produce them. Until Then, they can stay wrapped up in a box or cloth. Some examples:
- Carpenter: chisels, drill, rasp, mallet, hatchet, level, treenails, drawknife, chalkline, holdfast, cardscaper, whetstone.

Reselling Used Gear
You can sell items you bought for 1/3 as much as they normally cost, as long as you do so in a town or city, and your items are in good condition. If an item has been damaged, you can only sell it for 1/5 its original cost. If you find a well-disposed contact or an easy mark, you might be able to get a better price, up to 3/4.

Advancement
Characters start the game at zero level with no xp. In order to increase your level, you must gain xp. You gain xp by surviving forays into the nightmare incursions, recovering treasure and valuables, and defeating monsters.
Once you reach a certain amount of xp, you can exchange it for advancement. You can only increase by 1 level after each foray into a dungeon; you may not increase by 2 levels at once. Any excess experience points are lost.

Level 10
#Once you reach Level 10, you have essentially triumphed and won the game. At this point you have a choice to make: you may continue playing this character as if you were still Level 9, and no longer gain experience; or you may retire this character to safety. You may also decide to retire later.
When you retire, choose a location that is important to your character -- a place they have made their home, fought to defend, or tried to take control of. It can be as large as a town or as small as a farm or a single neighborhood, as long as your character has a connection to it as a whole and not just a smaller part of it.
From this point on, that location is no longer plagued by nightmare incursions until the end of your life. You have beaten the nightmare realm and your home is safe from the danger it presents, at least for a while. Other areas of the world might still be afflicted, but some other adventurers will have to save them -- 1 hero can only do so much.

People, Places, and Things
Finding people who will be your friend or who will help you obtain goods and services not normally available is best done by living in a settlement and socializing with its people. At the Judge's discretion, spending money might grant you an audience with, or an introduction to, an important person, although a reaction roll should still be used to determine their feelings.
Hiring retainers is a risky proposition, because they are almost certainly vulnerable to the nightmare incursions in ways that the PCs aren't. Even so, they can be useful.
Spending money on community institutions makes them more important. You know the players want to see more of something when they spend their hard-earned treasures on it. As an institution becomes more important, it begins offering unique opportunities, goods, and services.

Room and Board
Before the PCs can take advantage of most things a community has to offer, however, they have to spend some time (and money) living in it.

Down and Out in Pernicious Abandon
Between undertaking adventures, your characters live relatively normal lives, just like everyone else -- except they don't really have jobs -- and this costs money. If the PCs only need a night or 2 before they head back out, charge them 3$ at most, or get them to entertain the flophouse with a dashing story. If less than a couple of weeks go by between expeditions, simply deduct about 2d6 $ per week from each of the PCs. If they spend more time than that in the "real world" they are subject to all the economic and social vagaries of living like a responsible adult (or not, as the case may be).
Living on the streets costs nothing, but there is no rest, so you can't recover lost attribute points. When it comes time to undertake a new adventure, you must roll your Health or lower on a d20 or lose an additional 1d4 HP. You must roll 2d6 plus your Ferocity mod and consult the table below, applying an additional -1 penalty if you've been on the streets for more than a season, -2 if it's been more than a year, and -3 if it's been several.
0-6 \ All your money is gone, and so are all your possessions save for 1 (your choice).
-\-
7-9 \ All your money is gone, and so are half your possessions, your choice which. The Judge may decide that someone you met while on the streets has an opportunity for you.
10+ \ All your money is gone, but all your other possessions are still with you. You may also choose 1 contact to have made while living rough.

Living in Style
If you have enough to afford room and board, you're able to spend your days resting, recovering and training. Or you can go sight-seeing, make contacts, and do research. You must pay for 1 week minimum between adventures unless you spend a single night.
There are 3 levels of quality when you pay for room and board between adventures: you can live poorly, you can live well, or you can live like the rich.
Living poorly means staying at a flophouse or renting a hovel in the slums, and eating street food every day. This costs at least 10$ per week. When you return to adventuring after living poorly, roll 2d6 and add your Intelligence mod, applying an additional -1 penalty if you've been down and out for more than a season, -2 if it's been more than a year, and -3 if it's been several.
0-6 \ Life has not been kind to you. You have lost all your money, and made no useful contacts; although you may know several people who took advantage of you.
-\-
7-9 \ You may choose a contact to have made between adventures, as long as they are not a well-off person.
10+ \ You may choose 2 contacts to have made. At least 1 of them must be appropriate to your lifestyle.

Living well
comfortable clothes, comfy furniture, tasty food, 1 or more servants, and a relatively safe neighborhood. Lots of people live well, but not the majority. It costs at least 25$ per week.

Living rich
a very nice way to live, but it costs at least 100$ per week if you already have a home, or 250$ if you rent. The up-side is that when you return to adventuring, you have 1d4 servants that might accompany you, if you can talk them into it.

Staying in a hospital or a sanatorium means living well if it's a common institution, and living like the rich if you want first-class care. You may need to stay at either a hospital or sanatorium in order to recover points lost from certain attributes, depending on the wounds that caused them. If you stay in the first-class sanatorium, you may ignore the effects of 1 nightmare curse for the duration of the next adventure, after you are released.

If you decide to take a job as a servant, you get the benefits of living well at no cost to yourself, but you may not leave your boss's service without permission. If you do so, you cannot go back to being a servant in the future, and may be wanted by the authorities.

When you return to adventuring after living well or like the rich, roll 2d6 and add your Charisma mod (or your Social Status mod, if you wish).
0-6 \ You've run into a spot of trouble. Choose 1:
- an ally, contact, or friend (Judge's choice) is in danger and you have become involved, to 1 degree or another.
- you've offended the community (+1 Resentment).
- you've gained an Enemy.
- you've lost all your money.
- you lost an important possession or 2 (Judge's choice).
-\-
7-9 \ You may choose 1 contact to have made between adventures.
10+ \ You made 2 contacts between adventures.

If you spend a season or more living well or like the rich, you may choose an additional contact to have made between adventures.
If you spend a year or more living well or like the rich, you may increase your Social Standing by +1.

Buying and Selling

Villages
The availability of equipment is not very reliable in a village. You can buy anything that costs less than 10$ no problem, but the existence of more expensive items is not guaranteed. The Judge describes the state of the village and its resources -- if there is no tanner, for example, you can't get leather objects made. Also, if necessities like foodstuffs and livestock are in short supply, villagers will demand to be paid more for them, if they'll let them go at all.
Unless a village has a well-connected trader or banking house satellite, it cannot handle a large influx of wealth. Treasures worth more than a few hundred $ cannot be exchanged for money with villagers, though they might advance you some credit, expecting their hospitality to be repaid once you've returned to the city and dealt with the necessary bankers and merchants.
Villagers are almost never able to buy things you want to sell. If they are in need of weapons and armor, they usually look to their authority figures to provide guards and soldiers, or they scavenge battlefields. They don't often have the funds to supply their own militias with sophisticated gear.

Towns
Almost by definition, a town has all the basic attributes of a civil society -- banking, printing, smithing, tanning, trading, and a sophisticated bureaucracy. You can buy anything that costs less than 1000$ in your average town, but more expensive items can only be purchased if a town is known for producing goods of that type. A suit of plate can be purchased at a town famous only for its armorers, but a good wardog must be sought elsewhere.
Towns are always hubs of trade networks, so you can always get paid for your treasure there. If you want to sell your equipment, you can exchange it for 1/3rd as much as it normally costs, as long as it's in good condition. If it's been damaged, you can sell it for 1/5th of its original cost at most.

City
A city is a cosmopolitan place -- anything can be purchased there. These are the nexus of trade networks -- everything is available for a price. You can also exchange your treasure and sell your equipment, the same as you can in towns.

Special Goods
If you want to acquire special items that are not listed, it's up to the Judge to decide if and where they're available, and how much they cost. Healing potions, magic items, spells, and wild animals are not normally available for purchase. It may be possible to obtain these items by investing in laboratories, by joining a cult or other organization, or by developing special contacts. Investing in social institutions is another good way to obtain rare or specialized goods.

Magic Items
Magic items should rarely, if ever, be available for sale in the marketplace. They should be found in ancient ruins full of monsters, taken as loot from defeated enemies, or crafted specifically by the PCs or magicians in their employ. If they are valuable aside from being magical -- gilded, jewelled, or carved of precious jade -- they can contribute to experience points gained, but the magic itself is priceless and does not. If the PCs want to sell a magic item, it's up to them to find a buyer and negotiate a price, and such a fee would count as being obtained outside the dungeon.

Inflation
When you bring a large amount of treasure out of a nightmare incursion and inject it into a community, your treasure can become devalued. People think you are made of money and you're throwing money around like sand, and then they think there should be more of it for them, since you obviously don't care about it. The smaller the community, the more likely it is that prices will go up when you flaunt your loot -- city-folk have seen it all, they're pretty jaded.

Villages
If the influx of money into a village-sized settlement is...
- dozens of $, prices double for 2d6 weeks and then go back to normal
- hundreds of $, prices double for 2d6 months
- thousands of $, the settlement cannot handle that amount of money and the local economy collapses for a year or more

Towns
If the influx of money into a town-sized settlement is...
- hundreds of $, prices double for 2d6 weeks
- thousands, prices triple for 2d6 months
- tens of thousands, the settlement cannot handle that amount of money and the local economy collapses for a season or more

Cities
If the influx of money into a city is...
- thousands, prices increase by half for 2d6 weeks
- tens of thousands, prices double for 2d6 months
- hundreds of thousands, prices triple for a full season or more before there is a chance of them returning to normal.

Multiple influxes of money do not repeatedly cause inflation. If prices have already doubled, they don't double again. If they triple after being doubled, they are 3x their normal price.
If money is injected into a settlement repeatedly over the course of several days or weeks, it counts as a single influx.

Markets Returning to Normal
If the PCs return to a settlement that was subject to inflation after at least a few weeks away, the Judge rolls 2d6 and adds +1 for each month after the last influx of money:
0-3 \ prices are being kept artificially inflated
-\-
4-6 \ prices are the same, still inflated
7-9 \ prices are cheaper, but still high; inflation cut in half
10+ \ prices have returned to normal

Apply a -1 penalty for each of the following that are true:
- the authorities are attempting to keep prices high
- the local area has been devastated by natural disaster or war
- the local area is dangerous, due to bandits, creatures, or war
- many adventurer types are frequenting this settlement
- merchants have agreed to a price-fixing scheme
- the settlement is currently at war
- there are known nightmare incursions in the area that haven't been dealt with

After a full year passes, prices return to normal, unless someone is keeping them artificially inflated by manipulating the markets.

Creating Institutions
As much as those adventurer types want to act like cool loners who never have to ask anyone for anything, it's just not true. Sure, they go into dungeons on their own, but once they come out? All you ever hear from them is "Who wants to buy this old painting", or "I need these 17 weird pieces of equipment right away", or "I need a doctor, I'm dying over here".
The institutions of a civilized settlement can provide much-needed rest and relaxation opportunities, bustling markets and weapons dealerships, as well as social networks that can help adventurers gain info and plan their next foray into darkness.

Investing in Social Structures
You can also increase the prominence of different social institutions -- whether they are businesses, secret societies, or state-run infrastructures -- by spending money on them. The Judge decides what institutions are present in any specific settlement, but you can decide which ones you want your character to frequent.

Notable Institutions
Once you have spent at least 10k$ on an institution, it becomes notable, and remains available to perform 1 special service for you or anyone else. This service may be as simple as a doctor, or being the only supplier of wardogs in the region.

Significant Institutions
Once you've spent at least 100k$ on an institution, it becomes significant, an important aspect of the settlement. It's now a group or place that provides at least 2 types of special services, which may include being a source of info or goods.

Exceptional Institutions
Once you've spent at least 1m$ on an institution, it becomes exceptional. Not only important, it's also an influential and pervasive aspect of the campaign setting, an integral part of the settlement where it's located. It cannot be destroyed unless the entire settlement is, or it is attacked by another exceptional institution, and it's always possible to gain contacts from, or in, this institution.

These sums are based on how much all PCs, as a group, spend on a particular institution, not just individuals, although how much each individual contributes may have an effect on the institution's alignment.

Institutional Alignment
If the PCs who are spending money on an institution are overwhelmingly of 1 alignment, that institution will share their alignment. If the PCs spending money are of mixed alignments, the institution will be neutral. Some institutions lean towards a specific alignment instead of neutrality -- the courts are lawful, for example -- but they can still be corrupted and turned to a different purpose by wealthy PCs of different alignments.
Alternatively, if the PCs invest in an institution but quickly find themselves at odds with it, because of poor reaction roll results, or because of their own careless actions, you may decide that the institution should be the opposite alignment as they are. In this case, the institution is defined by being antagonistic to the PCs, instead of functioning as an outgrowth of their particular interests.
Characters gain advantage when they deal with an institution that shares their alignment. They are also at a disadvantage when they deal with a non-neutral institution of a different alignment. Neutral institutions treat all PCs the same, and neutral PCs get the same treatment from all institutions.
The alignment of an institution can change, if different PCs invest enough money to advance it to the next level. Once an institution becomes exceptional, however, its alignment is fixed and will not change unless it is destroyed and recreated.

Using Social Institutions
Institutions that become important usually have 1 or more of the following special characteristics:
- they buy goods recovered from nightmare incursions, act as a moneychanger, or otherwise allow PCs to exchange their goods for more useful things
- they can provide info not readily available elsewhere, either in the form of written records, or from people who make up their ranks
- they offer goods that are cheaper than normal, specialized, or unique in nature, or are made to order, individually customized for each and every patron
- they offer specialized services that cannot be obtained anywhere else, for love or money
- they protect the reputations of those who invest in it, and promote their economic, social, and even political aims
- they provide access to hirelings that might accompany you on your adventures, perhaps even into a dungeon

Interacting with an institution may require a successful reaction roll on the part of the PCs wishing to partake of its benefits. Alignment influences this roll.
The exact special qualities of an institution are determined by the Judge, although the interests of the investing PCs should be considered. Institutions can allow PCs to automatically do things that would otherwise require a roll, or to get things for free that would otherwise cost money. They can also make certain types of NPCs commonplace, or keep the Resentment scores of their PC members from increasing. Some examples:
- Apothecary: provides herbs and medicines, ointments, and tinctures. Chemists and doctors can be hired from here.
- Bank: Keeps your money safe. Can make anonymous purchases for you.
- Criminal gang: A steady supplier of criminal contacts.
- Law courts: You can sue people here, or give testimony about their crimes. Lawyers can be hired here.
- Library: Books contain knowledge. More books equals more knowledge.
- Sanatorium: Good medicine is worth paying for. And if they can also help you overcome a nightmare curse, you've found a veritable savant of a physiker
- Smithy: a proper smith or foundry can create customized works for you, to your exact specifications
- Teahouse: You can unwind here after a stressful adventure, and pick up important gossip.

You might also be interested in spending money on an academy, arena, bazaar, brewery, crematorium, cult, garrison, guild, monastery, park, theatre, or circus, depending on your character's wants and needs.

Dealing With People
When you meet someone in a normal circumstance (such as buying goods from them), they behave in a normal, expected manner. However, there may be times when you meet someone in an unexpected circumstance (in the wilderness, perhaps), or when you attempt to involve yourself in their life in an unexpected manner (hiring them for an adventure, for example).
In such cases, the Judge can ask you to make a reaction roll for NPCs. Roll 2d6 and add your Charisma mod (or your Social Status mod in cases where it is more important).

2d6 +Cha \ Normal Reaction Roll
-\-
0-3 \ They are immediately hostile, and may become violent.
4-6 \ They react negatively, being either uninterested in you and your business, or eager to be rid of you, but are not hostile (yet).
7-9 \ Their reaction is neutral, which could be anywhere from cautious to indifferent, based on their temperament. They give you time to catch their interest based on how busy they are.
10-11 \ Their reaction is friendly, generous, or interested. They're open to hearing what you have to say.
12+ \ They're immediately interested, in a positive manner.

On the other hand, you might have to shake someone down for info that will lead you to a nightmare incursion. If you are visibly threatening someone with egregious harm and immediate violence, roll 2d6 and add your Strength modifier.

2d6 +Str \ Intimidation Reaction
-\-
0-3 \ Instead of being intimidated, they fight back immediately, as hard as they can.
4-6 \ They're not intimidated. Instead, they try to escape, fight back, hold out on you, or even mislead you, depending on their nature.
7-9 \ They become unsure of themselves, and try to stall you long enough that they can escape. They surrender if they are overwhelmed, but their courage comes back if you leave them an opening.
10-11 \ They surrender, in the hopes of being treated leniently.
12+ \ They agree to switch sides just to avoid your terrible wrath.

Seeing A Man About A Dog
Sometimes you make the acquaintance of someone who is willing to do business with you on a regular or repetitive basis. Or perhaps you have actual friends, in spite of your suicidal vagabond lifestyle. People like that -- people you can ask for things you can't get through other avenues -- are called contacts.
If the public markets don't have what you're looking for, perhaps one of your contacts can hook you up. If you need info, but don't know who to ask, maybe 1 of your contacts can tell you what you need to know. They're probably more well-informed than you are, anyway.
When you make use of a contact, say what you want from them and roll 2d6. Add +1 if they come from a significant social institution, +2 if they come from an exceptional social institution, and +1 if you're the same class.

2d6 \ Result
-\-
0-3 \ Your contact is in serious trouble, and might even be dead already.
4-6 \ Your contact is either of no help whatsoever, or they might be able to help you if you can help them with a problem (Judge's choice).
7-9 \ Your contact has some useful info or they can get the goods that you need, but at a steep price. Perhaps they can also pass you on to someone else who can help you more effectively.
10-11 \ Your contact can get you what you need, or pretty close, for a fair price.
12+ \ Your contract has exactly what you need, for cheap. Or maybe they have something even better than you were expecting.

You can gain contacts by the actions you take during adventures, by accessing social institutions, and through the results of downtime rolls. Contacts can only get you information, goods, or introductions to other people if those things fall within the purview of their occupation, expertise, or social networks. A blacksmith probably can't find exotic poisons for you, and your average tanner knows nothing about the diamond trade.
The Judge may also decide that what you are looking for is definitely within the scope of a certain contact's abilities, and they always have what you need, and always at a fair price. They could still wind up in a spot of trouble, but whether the PCs decide to do anything about that is up to them.

Contacts
Creating or joining social networks in towns and cities can open up new opportunities for your characters. You can use them not only to obtain information about nightmare incursions, but also to obtain goods and services not normally available to outsiders. Contacts can be part of social structure investments, or no. The Judge has the final word when it comes to creating and defining the NPCs of the setting, but here are some ideas for contacts and what they can provide:
- Alchemists can create potions, and perhaps other things. They should at least be able to supply you with customized poisons and drugs.
- Arcane professionals might be cultists, scholars, or wizards. They can inscribe scrolls, which should cost you at least twice as much as the raw materials. They might also be able to provide you with info about the nightmare world, specific nightmare incursions, or other arcanists who could be corrupted.
- Criminals and their organizations can fence goods that you don't want to return to their rightful owners. They can also supply you with illegal goods.
- Cults can provide services based on their nature, but always demand some display of faith. At the very least, you should get an advantage when hiring retainers from inside the cult you belong to.
- Healers might be independent practitioners or part of a hospital or sanatorium. They can provide general healing for injured adventurers, or specific long-term care.
- Merchants can supply you with rare and exotic goods, or large quantities of goods. They might also be able to hook up with contacts in other cities, far away.
- Nobles and officials can shield you from other authorities, give you access to restricted places and records, or introduce you to other important people.
- Servants can help you break into their masters' homes, or supply you with gossip about the class of people they serve.
- Smiths can fashion metal implements under your direction, if you need something custom-made.
- Street urchins can run messages for you, keep watch on people or places, and supply you with gossip they heard on the streets. They might even help you rob someone.
- Cremators and other types of tomb-watchers can help you dispose of a body without alerting attention.

Tarnishing Your Reputation
It is possible to reduce a person's Charisma score by attacking them socially. If you organize a campaign to smear someone's public image though, you need to do more than make a single public speech. You need to reach many, many people. You can do this by actively spreading rumors, distributing pamphlets, hiring musicians to sing rude songs about them, parodying them in the theatre, or writing nasty letters about them to all your high-society friends and the tabloids. This can take days or even weeks; these attacks are only effective once per week.
In a village, roll 2d6 and add your Charisma modifier (or your Social Status modifier). In a town, roll 2d6 and add +1 for each 100$ you can spend on the attack. In a city, roll 2d6 and add +1 for each 1000$ you spend.

2d6+X \ Result
-\-
0-6 \ Your attack on the target's character and reputation has no effect.
7-9 \ Your attack increases the target's Resentment by d4.
10-11 \ Your attack increases the target's Resentment by d6.
12+ \ Your attack increases the target's Resentment by d8.
- *Bards deal an additional +1 Resentment damage.

You can also be the target of character assassination perpetrated by rich and influential NPCs. If they have enough rank, they can even inflict more than d8 Reputation damage. Remember: your characters are merely adventurers, not arch-dukes or the heads of guilds.

Resentment
Adventurers who deal with the nightmare realm on a regular basis usually mean trouble for the settlements they spend their downtime in. For each settlement, the Judge keeps track of a Resentment score for the group of PCs. Settlements aren't subtle, and paint your entire party with the same brush. Every settlement has a different Resentment score. The Judge is under no obligation to inform you of your Resentment score in any settlement.
If you take a valued member of the community into a nightmare incursion, and they are killed or go mad, your Resentment score increases by 1.
If you commit or are accused of a crime, your Resentment score increases by 1 if (and when) it becomes public. If you're proven innocent, nothing changes.
When your Resentment score increases, unless you get run out of town, the Judge rolls 1d6 or chooses an occurrence from the table below to see what happens as a direct reaction to your bad behavior:

1d6 \ Event
-\-
1 \ The authorities come to have "a talk" with you.
2 \ A gang or guild tries to persuade you to change your behavior.
3 \ A member of the community tries to persuade you to change your behavior, on their own initiative.
4 \ An organization or profession shuns you and refuses to deal with you.
5 \ Someone becomes your Enemy and begins to slander and libel you, trying to ruin your reputation.
6 \ Someone becomes your Enemy and tries to assault you.

Wearing Out Your Welcome
When a settlement resents you, it's only a matter of time before you wear out your welcome. When you make a public appearance or throw a public event, and whenever your Resentment score increases, the Judge rolls the community's settlement die to see if you have worn out your welcome. The larger the community, the larger the size of its settlement die. If the result of the roll is equal to, or lower than, your Resentment score, the community has had it up to here with your shit, and turns against you.

Size \ Population \ Die
-\-\-
Small village \ less than a hundred \ d4
Large village \ hundreds \ d6
Small town \ thousands \ d8
Large town \ tens of thousands \ d10
Small city \ hundreds of thousands \ d12
Large city \ millions \ d20

When you've worn out your welcome...:
- people refuse to help you out or do you favors
- prices are doubled (or even tripled)
- you can't attract hirelings or retainers of any kind
- next time your Resentment would increase, the community uses force to expel you

Reducing Resentment
As long as a community hasn't turned on you yet, you can always try to reduce the Resentment they have for you. You need to actually do something that contributes to the community, and you need to be public about it. You can either attach yourself or your name to this contribution from the start -- in which case, you risk wearing out your welcome even before people acknowledge the contribution -- or you can stage an event and then reveal yourself to be the benefactor after. If you're trying to return to a community that has already thrown you out, the latter strategy is the only viable one.
When you stage an event around a contribution to a community or its settlement, roll 2d6. Add +1 if you're donating hundreds of $ to a village, thousands of $ to a town, or tens of thousands of $ to a city. Add your Charisma modifier if you are appearing publicly as part of the event.

Roll \ Result
-\-
0-3 \ The community turns on you.
4-6 \ The community's attitude toward you doesn't change at all.
7-9 \ Your Resentment score in this settlement is lowered by 1, and you are tolerated once again, unless you are wanted for crimes you've committed.
10-11 \ Your Resentment score in this settlement is lowered by 2, and you are tolerated once again.
12+ \ Your Resentment score in this settlement is reduced to zero, and you are celebrated, your past deeds forgotten; for now.

Being tolerated again reverses the effects of wearing out your welcome, though specific groups might still maintain their enmity towards you, especially if you're a criminal.
If you can effectively assume a new identity, such that no one recognizes you, your Resentment scores are reduced to zero. If you assume the identity of another person, you inherit their Resentment scores (which are up to the Judge, if that person is an NPC), and any actions you take will modify the Resentment scores you now share with them.

Light Sources
Lights meant for purposes other than use in dungeons are all inferior to those presented here:
- a candle, either inside a simple lantern or not, casts light in all directions for 10ft and burns for 2 hours.
- a jar or simple lantern filled with fireflies, glow worms, or lightning bugs casts light in all directions for 20ft or in 1 direction for 30ft. It glows for 4 hours per day, unless the bugs are given special drugs, in which case they glow for 8 and then die.
- a mirrored lantern of any type casts light in some directions for 30ft or in 1 direction for 40ft. An oil lantern burns for 4 hours, and then must be refilled with another flask of oil, which cannot be done in the dark.
- a torch casts light in all directions for 30ft and burns for an hour before it becomes useless.

Exploring a hostile environment may cause light sources to become extinguished quicker than normal, due to constant jostling and ever-present dirt. The Judge will tell you when a light is close to going out. Taking a short or long rest in the dungeon uses up any currently-lit candles and torches, and any light source that remains lit during the rest is taxed a minimum of 1 hour of use.
In complete darkness, PCs may only attack someone they're touching, and moving carefully takes 6x as long.

Dropping Lights
You may have to throw your light sources onto the ground when a fight begins. Candles always go out when dropped. Jars of glowing creatures have between a 1in6 and a 5in6 chance of breaking and releasing their contents when dropped (depending on the type of ground). Lanterns don't go out when dropped, but have a 1in6 chance of breaking. Torches have a 50% chance of going out when dropped, unless they've just been lit.

Positioning
Attacking necessarily involves moving around quite a bit -- bobbing and weaving, dancing into position, trading places with your enemy after every lunge -- and this can be used to your advantage. If your attack roll is 11 or higher, you can either end your attack anywhere within 5ft of where you started, or move your enemy up to 5ft from where they started, as long as this doesn't cause them to fall off a cliff or something similar. Alternatively, if you're holding onto someone, you can move up to 5ft and drag them along with you (even over a cliff).
This dance of positioning can allow you to get to higher ground, jump over traps if you know where they are, or even to get in close with your opponent so you can grapple with them. But this rule only applies to standing position -- you can't push, trip, or disarm your opponent unless you employ a special maneuver with the intent of doing just that. Positioning is just about the struggle over who gets the most use out of the combat environment and their own fancy footwork.

Weapon Length
If you are charged by someone with a shorter weapon than you (i.e. they approach with the intent of attacking you), and you have not taken your turn this round, you may attack them instead of taking your turn later on. You attack first, interrupting their charge. If they survive, they're allowed to attack you immediately after, thus finishing their turn.
Below is a table of general comparisons between weapon lengths. Use your common sense or knowledge of your game's setting to determine the exact relationship between individual or special weapons that characters might use.

Length \ Weapons
-\-
Shortest \ no weapons at all, blackjacks, knuckles, palm-sized rocks
Shorter \ small improvised weapons, daggers and knives
Short \ small clubs and most hand-held tools, shortswords, 1-handed axes/clubs/hammers/maces/picks
Long \ 1-handed longswords/rapiers, 2-handed clubs/picks/staves, 2-handed axes/hammers/maces
Longer \ 2-handed swords, polearms
Longest \ pikes, spears
- * If you have a bow, crossbow, or firearm at the ready, it counts as longer than a pike, but you can't throw something or draw and fire when an enemy charges you.
- ** When you have been surprised, you can't attack first, no matter your weapon.

The Taint of Corruption
The nightmare realm is a dangerous place to go, even if you never encounter any monsters while you're there. The nightmare itself corrupts your mind, pollutes your senses, clutches at your heart. Alien thoughts creep into your own and friends turn against each other as the very fabric of their identities are rent asunder.
When an NPC leaves a nightmare incursion, if they've spent more than 1 hour inside, they must save against their Wisdom to avoid being cursed by the nightmare realm. If they spent 1 hour or more inside a nightmare incursion whose level is equal to or lower than their own level, they must roll equal to or lower than their Wisdom score on a d20 to avoid the curse. If they spent 1 hour or more inside a nightmare incursion whose level is greater than their own, they must roll equal to or lower than half their Wisdom score, rounded down, on a d20. Success means the nightmares send nothing else with them as they return to the Kingdom of Dreams. But if they roll higher, they automatically gain a nightmare curse that stays with them.
If an NPC spends more than 1 day inside a nightmare incursion, they must save against their Wisdom once for each day they were inside. Each time they roll higher, they gain a different nightmare curse.

Those Set Apart
The PCs are immune to this property. They are special in this regard -- set apart from other mortals. If anyone could venture easily into the nightmare world, it would be easy to fight its incursions into the Kingdoms of Dreams. If no one was immune, it would be impossible. Those few whose minds can survive the nightmares are all that stand between the nightmares and the end of civilization -- indeed, of life itself.
This does not mean that no PCs ever go mad while raiding the nightmare world. Anyone who suffers attribute loss from any means other than physical attacks and injuries risks gaining a nightmare curse if they lose half or more of their score in a single round. This is true of both PCs and NPCs. The nightmares can imprint their nature even on those set apart, altering their way of being and thinking, and leaving a taint upon their souls.

Dealing With The Madness
It is up to the GM when a nightmare curse begins to take effect. It might happen immediately, or it might only manifest after a person leaves a nightmare incursion. This is true of both curses that afflict NPCs and curses gained through attribute loss. Curses are not temporary and do not go away when attribute scores are regained.

The Nightmare's Curses
If you lose half or more of 1 of your current attribute ratings in a single round while inside a nightmare incursion, if the cause was something other than injuries and wounds, you must roll to avoid gaining a nightmare curse. If the dungeon level is equal to or lower than your own, you must roll equal to or lower than your Wisdom score in order to avoid a nightmare curse. If the dungeon level is higher than your own, you must roll equal to or lower than half your Wisdom score, rounded down, to avoid a nightmare curse. If you fail your Wisdom save, you must roll d100 to determine what nightmare curse afflicts you:
NPCs who fail to save against their Wisdom after spending an hour or more inside an incursion roll on this table as well.
You can't be cursed more than once each by any of these effects. Reroll if the result is something you have already been cursed with.

Lifting the Curse
It is always possible that you could find a way to cure someone of their nightmare curse. You might find a healing spell powerful enough, or an exorcist holy enough, or a magical item that can do the job.
In all such endeavours, however, it is important to remember that every curse is actually a living creature of nightmare that dwells inside the mind or body of the afflicted. It lives as they live and dies when they die, yes -- but if removed from its host, this nightmare enters the material world, free and self-aware. It cannot build an incursion or summon other nightmares unless it finds an anchor, true, but it can certainly try to murder the people who drew it from its host.

Creating a Nightmare Incursion
Beyond the veil of sleep, beyond the stars, beyond time and space itself, lies a world full of nightmares, conscious and solid. This nightmare realm has seen the waking world, and tasted its fears, and it hungers for more. In order to invade the Kingdoms of Dreams, the nightmare realm creates self-contained spaces that act as bridges, allowing nightmare creatures to influence the human world and letting humans enter the nightmare world. Because these incursions are constrained spaces, they usually take the form of caves and tunnels and built environments like dungeons.
Nightmare incursions are composed of multiple individual lairs. Each lair is controlled by one specific type of nightmare, called the crown, which also determines the appearance and character of the lair. Lairs are ranked by level, just like characters are. The higher level a lair is, the closer it is to the nightmare realm and the more dangerous it's crown is.
Lairs are not stable creations, however. In order to exist, they require an anchor.
Any material object infused with strong emotion by humans can function as an anchor -- the more the item was, or is, valued, the stronger the lair attached to it can be. This does not mean the anchor must always be monetarily valuable, though this is often the case.
It is also easier for lower-level lairs to maintain a portal that accesses the waking world directly. It requires some kind of will or action by human beings in order for the connection to be made, and lairs closer to the nightmare realm itself are harder for the human mind to comprehend. Because of this, most incursions are composed of numerous lairs, with the lowest-level lairs being points of entry for humans. But even if an incursion’s connections to the waking world are destroyed, any lair that still has an anchor may reach out to the sleeping minds of humanity and influence someone to create a new portal.

Cults on the Borderlands
When a nightmare incursion is discovered, adventurers inevitably arrive to attack it. Although a wave of descending humanity can be good for the nightmares in the short term, it often means destruction in the long term. Nightmares prefer to find corrupted humans to hide the entrances to their incursions, so they can spread corruption covertly.
These corrupted outposts are run by servants of nightmare, or even by inhuman monsters, but are not part of the incursions themselves. They can exist in the midst of a bustling civilization without being obvious. Normal people can come and go, pass by and through, without being subjected to curses and madness. Only those the outpost’s minions capture specifically have the taint inflicted upon them.

Step 1: The Crown
Every lair in a nightmare incursion is controlled and inhabited by a particular type of creature -- a thing composed of nightmares to terrify the human soul. There might be a single nightmare creature of great power, but usually the lair is able to spawn an unlimited number of nightmares whose level is the same as that of the lair.
You can use the nightmare creation procedures presented later in this chapter, choose a nightmare creature from the bestiary, or use your own methods for creating monsters. The crown represents the main risk and the main threat to the PCs who venture into the lair, even though there might be other monsters inside it, and other dangers. Until the anchor is removed or destroyed, the crown will always be there.

Lair Type
There are 4 types of dungeon lairs, each indicating what type of threat is foremost in the lair. You can wait and choose the lair type when you roll for the additional threats, or you can choose a lair type as part of determining the crown. Choosing now can help you imagine the lair’s flavour and the history behind the thoughts and emotions fuelling it.

Deathtrap Dungeons
Full of traps instead of monsters. The environment itself is treacherous and lethal, designed to lure people in and destroy them in gruesome manners. In a deathtrap dungeon, PCs have more time to work carefully, but if they don’t take that time, death and dismemberments quickly follow.

Heretic Temples
Inhabited by crazed people who worship the nightmare realm and work to spread its corruption when they eventually return to the world above.
The danger of this type of dungeon lies in the fact that there are people here -- and not all of them voluntarily, perhaps, but because of the corrupting nature of the nightmare realm, they are all unstable.

Monster Hordes
Lairs that inhuman monsters have flocked to. They work for, or with, the nightmare creatures that control the lair in some kind of symbiotic or parasitic relationship. Monsters are a more immediate threat than human minions, but have a harder time becoming a threat to human society proper.

Spawning Pits
Have more nightmare creatures than any other threat. Their main purpose is to absorb the fears and night terrors of humans in order to spawn new nightmare incursions. These lairs are more concerned with creating these nightmare creatures, rather than trapping people or attracting allies.

Step 2: The Anchor
The anchor is the object or objects that tie the nightmare realm to the material plane. 
These objects must have been suffused with human emotions before being stolen by nightmares to be used as anchors, and the nightmares also feed off these emotions, using them to help create the features of their lairs.

Value
Because expensive objects are often valued quite highly by their owners and those that covet them, the anchor may be of great monetary value on its own -- a gemstone or a chest full of gold coins, for example -- or it might be an otherwise worthless item, in which case the monetary value determines how much a collector will pay to possess it. Some collectors may have nefarious uses for such items, however.
To determine the monetary value of the anchor in a nightmare incursion lair, roll 2d6 and add the lair level:

Roll \ Monetary Value
-\-
3 \ 1d10
4 \ 1d10 x2
5 \ 1d10 x5
6 \ 1d10 x10
7 \ 1d10 x20
8 \ 1d10 x50
9 \ 1d10 x100
10-11 \ 1d10 x200
12-13 \ 1d10 x500
14-15 \ 1d10 x1000
16-17 \ 1d10 x2000
18-19 \ 1d10 x5000
20+ \ 1d10 x10k
- * It's impossible to determine the exact value of an anchor until they removed from the dungeon.

Size & Weight
Roll 1d6 to determine the size and weight of the anchor, as expressed by its encumbrance value. It may consist of multiple items -- half a dozen diamonds, a pair of swords, a stack of loose paper -- as long as it adds up to the specific encumbrance rating determined by the roll:

Roll \ Anchor Weight
-\-
1-2 \ Small or tiny item.
3-4 \ 1 encumbrance.
5 \ 1d6 encumbrance worth of item(s).
6 \ 2d6 encumbrance worth of item(s).

An encumbrance result of 7-9 may also indicate an oversized item (such as a piece of furniture), and a 10+ may indicate multiple oversized items. A PC can only carry one oversized item at a time, and some may require more than one person to carry. Or the anchor can be a hoard of seven or more encumbering items.
There are random tables in the appendix (pages 400-409) to help you decide what kinds of items make up a lair’s anchor.

Step 3: Additional Threats
The crown and anchor are not the only important elements of a nightmare incursion.
Lairs attract other monsters and corrupted humans, and the nightmares cannot help but fill their lairs with traps and special features that reveal their true natures.
If you have not already chosen a lair type, choose one now: deathtrap dungeon, heretic temple, monster horde, or spawning pit.

Corrupted Outpost
If this lair can be accessed directly from the Kingdoms of Dreams -- as opposed to being accessible only from other nightmare incursion lairs -- roll to see if there is a corrupted outpost attached to it:
- If the lair is a deathtrap, there's a 1in6 chance of a corrupted outpost, maintained by any type of corrupted human or monster.
- If the lair is a heretic temple, there's a 2in6 chance of a corrupted outpost maintained by corrupted humans.
- If the lair is a monster horde, there's a 2in6 chance of a corrupted outpost maintained by inhuman monsters.
- If the lair is a spawning pit, there's a 3in6 chance of a corrupted outpost maintained by either corrupted humans or inhuman monsters.

If a corrupted outpost is present, the passage to the nightmare incursion is located inside of it, either as a hidden doorway or displayed prominently where civilization cannot see it. A corrupted outpost counts as a lair of 1 level lower than the lair whose entrance it guards, has no anchor, and is maintained by a group of people or monsters instead of nightmares.

Other Elements
Roll 1d6 and add the lair's dungeon level to determine how many additional elements the lair contains. For each additional element, roll a d6 to determine what type of element it is:

Roll \ Corrupted Outpost \ Deathtrap \ Temple \ Horde \ Pit
-\-\-\-\-\-
1 \ Corrupted \ Monster \ Corrupted \ Monster \ Monster
2 \ Monster \ Special \ Corrupted \ Monster \ Nightmare
3 \ Special \ Special \ Monster \ Special \ Special
4 \ Special \ Trap \ Special \ Special \ Special
5 \ Special \ Trap \ Special \ Trap \ Trap
6 \ Trap \ Trap \ Trap \ Trap \ Trap
- * Then add 1 more special feature per level and 1 more trap per level.

Corrupted
Any type of human can be corrupted by nightmares. They aren't required to be cultists, though professional nightmare cultists do exist. Roll d20:

d20 \ Type
-\-
01 \ Assassin
02-03 \ Bandit
04 \ Champion
05 \ Cultist
06 \ Fighter
07 \ Mercenary
08-09 \ Noble
10-11 \ Peasant
12-13 \ Proletariat
14 \ Scholar
15-17 \ Servant
18 \ Thaumaturgist
19 \ Thief
20 \ Wizard

Monsters
Any kind of monster, nightmare creature, or human antagonist. Roll on any table, including d20 on this one which excludes humans and nightmares:

d20 \ Type
-\-
01 \ Beastmen
02 \ Blackbirds
03 \ Crab-dogs
04 \ Dragons
05 \ Eclipse wolf
06 \ Faerie nobles
07 \ Goblins
08 \ Hellhounds
09 \ Illuminators
10 \ Iridescent globes
11 \ The kraken
12 \ Lamprey golems

14 \ Revenants
15 \ Rittersnakes
16 \ Silent accusers
17 \ The Simurgh
18 \ Tomb guardian
19 \ The underfolk
20 \ Wasp riders

Nightmares
Another nightmare creature inhabits this lair. Roll 1d12:

d12 \ Type
01 \ abductors
02 \ adepts of the flame
03 \ the cavemurdered
04 \ false children
05 \ glass thieves
06 \ hive mothers
07 \ locust butchers
08 \ shadows of pain
09 \ skull-faced fiends
10 \ the stalker
11 \ thorn priests
12 \ wound men

d6 \ Special Feature
1 \ danger
2 \ enhancement
3 \ resource
4 \ reveal
5 \ subterfuge
6 \ transformer

Special Features
Not everything inside a dungeon is an immediate threat to the PCs. Some aspects of the environment present special opportunities that can be used by the monsters against the PCs, but also by the PCs themselves, if they can seize the initiative. For each special feature, roll a d6 to determine its nature.

Danger
It’s not an active threat, but an existing hazard that is part of the environment. It can be dangerous to both PCs as well as monsters. A bottomless chasm, a fast-flowing river, fungal growths that release poisonous spore clouds when disturbed, metal rods that attract lightning strikes, poisonous fruit, a raging bonfire, or stinging thorns and nettles.

Enhancement
A feature that increases the power of a threat in the dungeon, be it monster, trap, or danger. The enhancement can be removed, if the PCs discover how. An alarm that reveals the PCs and their location, a balcony that only the monsters know how to access, a psychic monolith that increases the range of nightmare creatures’ powers, a supply of drugs that induce in the cultists a berserk rage, or any danger that the monsters are immune to.

Resource
An obvious feature of the dungeon that can be used for advantage by monsters and PCs alike. An alchemical pool with magical waters, an area of high ground that is hard to get to, an elevator, a garden of weapons, a magic gate that leads to some other part of the dungeon, or a scrying pool shows other areas.

Reveal
Anything that shows the story behind the nightmare incursion’s creation. Diaries and journals, paintings and photographs, visions of the past, remnants of a person’s life.

Subterfuge
Anything that hides a monster, trap, or danger from being easily uncovered. This can be a deliberate subterfuge, or unwitting. Illusory flooring or stairs, a maze, overgrown plants and vines, persistent fog, secret doors, monsters disguised as statues, or a wizard with the invisibility spell.

Transformer
A feature that changes the tactical situation in the dungeon drastically whenever it is used. Giant plants that secrete gallons of sticky resin when cut, illusory creatures, lockable metal doors that all take different keys, a room that moves from place to place, rooms that fill up with water, a source of illumination that turns on and off, or windows that let the winter cold inside.

Traps
A feature of the environment that is dangerous or deadly. Traps can be built by the nightmare realm or by others who inhabit it, whether humans or other monsters.
Interacting with traps created by nightmares attracts the attention of nightmares, and creating a commotion by falling victim to a trap tends to attract other monsters. And then there is the problem of the trap itself.
For each trap, choose or roll 1d12 to determine what type it is:

d12 \ Trap Type
01 \ alarm or summoning
02 \ ceiling (blade, falling objects, gas, nets, etc.)
03 \ crushing
04 \ dart or projectile
05 \ drowning or liquid
06 \ explosion, fire, flash, or lightning
07 \ falling or transportation (pit, chute, moving hallway, etc.)
08 \ fog, gas, or smoke (maybe toxic)
09 \ illusion
10 \ infection or poison
11 \ insanity or mind control (reduces Int or Wis)
12 \ locking door, maze, or prison

Example effects:
- an alarm demands a wandering monster check every 1d6 rounds
- a blinding flash causes blindness for 1d6 rounds; save vs Dex to close eyes in time
- falling inflicts 1d6 damage per 15ft
- fog or smoke obscures environment; save vs Int or miss noticing hidden dangers
- insanity deals 1d6 damage to Int, save for half
- a locked door can be battered down, save vs Str after 1 turn
- mind control deals 1d6 damage to Wis and implants a command; save vs Wis to resist command
- poison deals 1d6 damage (or Dex, if paralytic)
- projectiles make attack rolls; add the dungeon's level, deal 1d6 damage
- slippery liquid causes you to fall unless you save vs Dex
- summoning trap causes nightmare or other monster to appear

Step 4: The Map
Once you have a crown, an anchor, and a collection of other elements, you need to place them on a map of the lair. You can draw a new map or use one you already have.
You can place elements in diff erent places or double them up. You can leave sections of your map empty, or add new lairs for those sections. The number of elements you have in a lair does not have to reflect the size or number of areas on the map.
Some dungeons are crammed full, with death around every corner. Others are almost wastelands, they’re so full of empty, unused rooms.

Areas
A cavern, room, or collection of adjacent spaces that have a feature in them count as a single area. If there are multiple features in the same place, it is still a single area. A large group of empty rooms may also count as a single area.
You should have a rough idea of where an area inhabited by an important feature begins and ends. It should be hard or impossible to interact with both areas without standing directly on the threshold between them. When the PCs cross these borders for the first time, the nightmare realm can sense them, and it reacts to them.

Connections
Dungeons can be single lairs only, if you want, or you can create massive subterranean structures full of nightmares, connected by whatever types of passageways make sense (or even ones that don’t, at least not to outsiders). Larger dungeons should be arranged by level, with the lowest level having the most number of portals to the material plane. As adventurers delve deeper into the dungeon, they move from one level to another, with each subsequent level having a higher rating than the last. Each lair that makes up a particular level has the same level rating.
This is not a strict rule, though. A Level 1 lair could have a passageway leading to a Level 4 lair, for example, and a dungeon designed for high-level characters might only have high-level lairs in it.

Entrances: Tunnel Incursions
How a nightmare incursion actually manifests on the material plane depends on its structure. The simplest structure is a tunnel incursion, which has only one main entrance. Adventurers must get through low-level lairs in order to access those of higher level. The basement of a house, for example, could lead to deeper basement levels, all made of nightmares. But a remote valley, with only one safe point of access, can also serve to hold a tunnel incursion.
Because of its mostly-linear structure, the tunnel incursion lends itself to enclosed spaces, including both subterranean or built environments. But it can also work in a more open environment, such as in an isolated mountain valley, where intruders must travel through one lair to get to the next, repeatedly. There are other ways in, and ways of bypassing lairs of the lower levels, but it requires clever thinking or planning ahead.
The advantage, and disadvantage, of a tunnel is that it follows a straight line -- easier to prepare for, but with less room for the players’ choices to really matter.
But since the most important feature of a tunnel incursion is that it has only a single entrance, you can vary things up considerably once the PCs get inside, by creating areas that loop around or are connected to numerous other areas instead of just one.

Entrances: Hive Incursions
Somewhat more complex is the hive incursion, where numerous lairs have entrances connected to the waking world. They might be connected to each other by passageways within the incursion, or only by the material structure that contains their entrances.
A haunted mansion, whose doors often lead to rooms that do not, and never have, existed anywhere on earth, is one example of a hive incursion. Another would be a cave complex whose tunnels may lead explorers to vast, natural caverns, or deeper into the nightmare world.
In a hive incursion, the straight line can be the only part of the dungeon that exists in the material world, while each of the many passageways leading off from it are either individual lairs, or entire tunnel incursions unto themselves.

Entrances: Zone Incursions
The format of the zone incursion is the loosest. In these dungeons, lairs occupy a specific area of the world, overlapping it and allowing nightmares to wander it freely.
Lairs do not have to touch each other, though each can also lead to both hive and tunnel incursions, if you wish. This type of incursion works best in wilderness areas, with lairs scattered across remote plains, swamps, or forests. But it can also serve for a house, inside whose rooms dwell nightmare creatures, but whose doors do not lead one into places that exist only in the realm of nightmares.
A zone incursion is more or less open to the waking world on all sides, more so than a tunnel incursion that is open to the sky above but blocked on either side (as in the mountain valley example). The weakness these dungeons share is that they can both be spoiled quite easily by daylight. Nightmares grow mighty under the cover of darkness, but lose their impact once exposed and seen clearly.
The tight confines of interior spaces likewise work to strengthen nightmares, trapping you inside their domains. Outside, the night can serve a similar function, pressing down from all directions, whereas brightly-lit open areas tend to dilute the sensation of horror that incursions employ as a weapon against the Kingdoms of Dreams. Keep this in mind when designing your own nightmare dungeons.

Themes
Dungeons created by the nightmare realm are not limited to what could, realistically, be built underground (or even above ground, for that matter).
Corrupted outposts should probably follow such logic, but nightmare incursions inhabit other dimensions, part of some other plane of existence.
They are made of the same things nightmare creatures are made of: peoples’ nightmares.
Roll 1d20 or choose the materials that the interior structures of your dungeon are made of. The entire dungeon might be mostly the same material, or it could be diff erent for each lair, or each area of each lair.
Alternately, if you want your dungeon to be made from memories of structures entirely built by human hands, and themes around one or more specific structures, you can roll 1d20 on the following table to generate a random result:

d20 \ Materials \ Structure
-\-\-
01 \ bricks and mortar \ baths or pools
02 \ bricks and mortar \ castle
03 \ carved rock \ country manor
04 \ cloth, fabric, rope \ crypt or tomb
05 \ crystal or glass \ display rooms
06 \ earthen construction \ forges
07 \ earthen construction \ gardens
08 \ earthen construction \ halls
09 \ flesh and meat \ hospital
10 \ human house \ jail cells
11 \ human house \ mining tunnels
12 \ natural caves \ offices
13 \ natural caves \ palace
14 \ plants, roots, thatch, trees \ sailing ship
15 \ stonework \ school
16 \ stonework \ shops
17 \ stonework \ tannery
18 \ stonework \ tenements
19 \ stonework \ torture chambers
20 \ wood construction \ workshop

Wilderness Themes
Incursions in the wilderness can take many different forms. One might be subtle, a darkening veil draped across the earth, while another presents a vision of an alien world, drawn from the overactive imagination of a febrile sorcerer and invasively reproduced by the nightmare realm. An incursion need not have any thematic connection to the lands around it -- arctic tundra in the middle of a tropical jungle, a fiery pit deep inside the forest, or a haunted castle in the midst of sand dunes are all appropriate forms for an incursion to take.
Roll 1d20 on one of the following tables for inspiration when placing normal or abnormal wilderness features in front of the PCs:

01 \ arroyo
02 \ bones
03 \ caves
04-05 \ dead tree

Creating Nightmares
Every lair that is part of a nightmare incursion, of whatever level, is run by one type of nightmare creature. Ideally, every incursion has a different collection of nightmare creatures, but this is not always feasible, and different lairs in the same incursion lose little if they are run by the same type of nightmare. But the nightmare realm builds itself out of the actual nightmares and inner lives of human beings, so nightmare creatures should have some connection to the environment in the lairs they inhabit.

Concept
First you need an idea. What type of thoughts, dreams, and emotions is this nightmare formed out of? What experiences led to those feelings, and how does the dungeon reflect them? Every nightmare incursion is created from the negative experiences of humans, as they perceive them inside their hearts and minds. Devise a situation of your own, or roll 1d10 one or more times to determine the primary emotions that created the nightmare, and answer some of the related questions.
Second, imagine how this creature turns those emotions and experiences into weapons that it can use against people? Does it attack the body, the mind, or the soul? Does it take a humanoid form? Or is it an animal, a cloud, a weapon that moves on its own, or a psychic monolith? Is it a ghost that cannot be touched?
Nightmares of Levels 1-3 should be entirely physical in nature. They are too close to the material world to be anything else. Nightmares of Levels 4-6 might be intangible spectres, or immune to physical harm that isn’t magical, but should at the very least still resemble tangible creatures. Nightmares of Levels 7 or higher might have any kind of form you can imagine.
Next, picture in your mind the kind of person whose inner life gave birth to this creature. Even the good things they remember can be used as traps and weapons by the nightmare realm, even though it is the negative experiences -- the pains, fears, and doubts they had -- that nightmare incursions are truly made of. Use those elements as you construct this creature.
The person or people who instilled their emotions into the anchor can all contribute aspects of their inner lives to the nightmare creatures, but so can others who have died at this spot, or in the presence of nightmares. First contact with the nightmare realm was made by sorcerers in ancient times, but now that the barrier between it and the mortal world has been penetrated so many times, even normal people’s thoughts and feelings can be stolen and used. PCs that die inside a nightmare incursion can also contribute, as well as those that spend enough time in the wilderness near areas that have been corrupted. Make sure to ask the players questions about what their PCs are afraid of, what they have doubts about, and what they think of their job. You can use those details later on, to build your dungeons.
And finally, think about what the people involved cherished and loved, and how this nightmare incursion can oppose those feelings. Does it use those things as bait, luring the unwary to their doom? Does it show those things, over and over again, but debased and ruined? What does it do to prevent those feelings from occurring?

d10 \ Emotions
01 \ alienation
02 \ anger, hatred, rage
03 \ anxiety, fear, paranoia, terror
04 \ apathy, failure, ruin

Alienation
What do other people desire that you do not? What would it be like to have the dungeon show you these things, again and again? How would it do that? How do people shut you out and exclude you? How are these monsters similar?
- Alien monsters are hard to understand or deal with. The attack Int, destroying your ability to comprehend the world properly.
- Feelings of alienation attract dwellers in the deep.
- A lack of emotional connection makes creating golems an attractive option.

Anger, Hatred, Rage
What makes you angry? How could the monster make you angry? What mistakes could you make, or have you made, in anger? How does the dungeon preserve and repeat that? How have you been wronged? What if you could have revenge?
- Angry monsters inflict terrible injuries, but have few defences.
- Hate monsters are specialized to deal with certain foes.
- A need for revenge attracts undead creatures.
- Rage strikes quickly and overwhelmingly.

Anxiety, Fear, Paranoia, Terror
What makes you want to run away? What makes your skin crawl? How are the monsters here like that? How is the dungeon shaped to amplify those feelings?
- Anxiety destroys confidence, creates uncertainty.
- Fear causes you to turn back and run away.
- Illusions cause friends to be suspicious, and turn against each other.
- Paranoid monsters have numerous weapons.
- Terror causes either panic or immobility.
- Wanderlust built on a fear of being tied down attracts other monsters, especially faeries and dwellers in the deep.

Apathy, Failure, Ruin
What is the worst kind of destruction and ruin? What causes it? How does the dungeon preserve or perpetuate it? How have you failed? How do the monsters remind you of that?
- Apathy causes immobility and inaction.
- Callous monsters are easily defeated, but even as they're destroyed, their nihilistic influences cause ruin.
- False hope is a powerful reminder of your failings and the inevitable ruination that awaits you. False friends, false floors, false exits.
- Nightmares that wear the faces of people you failed.
- Ruin can affect the mind or body, or even gear.

Desire, Envy, Greed, Pride
What do you want that you can’t have? How would the nightmares taunt you if they knew? What would they do to humiliate you? Imagine what someone would do if they wanted something so badly that nothing else mattered. How is the anchor connected to similar events? What if a person was so obsessed with their own deeds, rank, or possessions, they could think of nothing else? How could the dungeon use this against you? How could the monsters wear it for all to see? How could you go too far in displaying your achievements? How would you feel about being celebrated for something that wasn’t your doing? Could you give up everything that fills you with pride in order to survive?
- All treasure is trapped, and most of it fake.
- Monsters use the lure of treasure, sex, eternal youth, and other rewards to entrap humans.
- Monuments and statues come alive, show themselves to be better than you.
- Windows can show you what you quest after, even as they keep you away from it. Only monsters may pass through them.

Disgust
What makes your skin crawl? What makes you stare in revulsion and horror? How does the dungeon show you these things and make you watch them?
- Defeating an enemy does not guarantee you are rid of them. Grotesque and broken, the dead and wounded harry you still.
- Disgusting things infect your gear, inspiring revulsion in you whenever you make use of them, carry them, or even look at them.
- The sight of someone's insides, exposed to view.
- The unwelcome juxtaposition of unrelated elements lead to the innocent of the pair becoming poisoned in the mind of the audience.

Gluttony, Indulgence, Lust
What happens when you overindulge? How do the monsters reflect that? Who pays for the pleasures you enjoy, and how do they feel about it? How do your pleasures own you? How does the dungeon offer you indulgence?
- Gluttony and lust blur the lines between emotional and physical distress. The hunger makes you compulsive and nervous, but overindulgence leads to heartbreak and nausea, roiling delirium and aching flesh.
- Indulgence attracts faeries.
- Moderation is anathema to gluttony. Extremes are the norm: it's always either feast or famine. So too with the glutton's dungeons.

Grief, Loss, Sadness
What are you afraid to give up? What would you hate to lose? How does the dungeon take those things away? What have you lost or left behind? What causes regret -- anger, failure, negligence, weakness? How could the dungeon remind you of that, in the worst possible way?
- Amputation, whether real or illusory.
- Blankets of melancholy, a weight pressing down on everything.
- A death obsession or suicidal ideation attracts undead creatures.
- The faces of those who died come back to haunt you.

Hunger, Thirst, Need
What can’t you live without? What would you do if you had to? How could the dungeon prevent you from getting what you need, and what would happen?
- Constant reminders of going without the things you need.
- Needy monsters sap your resources, take away your abilities, possessions, hope.
- The slow drain, like sheets of ice.
- Your stomach, knotted with hunger. A wild animal writhes inside your guts.

Pain
What causes damage, hurt, injury, and pain? How do the monsters employ that? How do you react to pain? How does the dungeon thrive on it?
- The invasiveness of pain that creeps into your guts, your joints, into your brain where it forces out all other thoughts.
- Pain lets you know you're alive. Thrill-seekers and adrenaline junkies are attracted to the promise of pain.
- Pain limits your ability to concentrate, to plan, and to react with kindness.
- The same of being seen while in pain.

Nightmare Fuel
Nightmare creatures and incursions both are made from the unpleasant dreams, thoughts, and memories of people. Without these, the nightmare realm is nothing -- or at least it has no way to physically manifest itself on the material plane.
The careless rituals or foolish and headstrong wizards provided the nightmare realm with its original material and footholds in this world. But these days, the most common source of nightmares is the minds of people near incursions.
However, the nightmares have a hard time discerning an individual’s thoughts and imaginations in the dense chaos of a settlement’s population. Extremely strong feelings may push a person into the nightmares, especially if they can provide an anchor, but this is rare. It is usually only when a person uses magical rituals to open themselves, or when they die inside a nightmare incursion, that they show themselves and their minds clearly to the nightmare realm, shining brightly through the fog of civilization.
When you die inside a nightmare incursion, the nightmare realm can plunder your dreams and memories and use whatever negative emotions it finds there to make new nightmares out of.

The average nightmare has these stats:
- Level equal to the level of its lair (chaotic or evil) nightmare.
- Armour 10+level, Hit Die 1d6, Morale +1, Numbers *, Speed 7, Surprise 0. Cha 0, Dex 10, Fer 10, Hth 0, Int 10, Wil 10.
- Skills: Choose one or more things the monster is particularly good at.
- 1 attack per round.
- Choose a source of harm that deals double damage.
- Choose a source of harm that deals no damage.
- A special ability, attack, defence, or trait that makes this creature unique.

Then choose a number of benefits equal to their level, or more, and a few flaws, as well. If you scatter hints about a creature’s weaknesses throughout its lair, you can reward the players for paying close attention. A monster with fewer benefits than its level plus its flaws is considered weak. A monster with more benefits than its level plus flaws is considered strong.
If you give your monster a powerful version of a benefit -- six attacks per round, or a d12 for its Hit Die, for example -- consider counting that as more than one benefit when determining how strong or weak it is.
Monsters of Level 4-6 should either attack as fighters or have at least 2 attacks per round. Monsters of Level 7-9 should have at least 3 attacks per round.

Flaws & Weaknesses
- Armour is worse than 10+level.
- Conspicuous (gives the PCs a bonus to surprise rolls).
- Damage is lower than hit die (penalty or smaller die size).
- Double damage from a source of harm.
- Hit Die is 1d4.
- Low numbers in chance encounters (1d6 or fewer).
- Low numbers in their lair (fewer than 2d10).
- Negative morale (-1 or lower).
- No physical attack.
- Restricted movement (can’t walk, no limbs, etc).
- Two or more attributes are always very low.
- Vulnerability to a common situation or substance (sunlight, water, etc).

Creating good monsters is an art, not an exact science. The difficulty that the PCs have in overcoming a specific type of monster should affect the amount of treasure they stand to gain should they do so, but real people all have diff erent talents, strengths, and ideas, so a challenge that one group has trouble wrapping their heads around might seem like a walk in the park to another.
If your players are clearing incursions too easily, reduce the amount of treasure they find, or start making tougher monsters. If the PCs are dying too easily, tone your monsters down by reducing their numbers or their special abilities.
You can use the lists above to help roughly determine the numbers a nightmare appears in, or ignore those entries and base your decision on the relative power level of the monster, compared to its level. Weak creatures tend to band together in gangs and swarms, while the mighty travel alone -- just make sure your solitary creatures can handle fighting multiple opponents.

Numbers
The average nightmare should appear in numbers like 1d6 (2d10) or 1d8 (3d6). For weaker nightmares, bump those numbers up. For stronger, more solitary creatures, reduce them. A creature’s lair numbers should never be less than two dice, and not less than 2d6 unless these monsters are incredibly overpowered for their level.
Creatures that attack in swarms might have up to 3d4 (6d10) for numbers.
Those that form gang-like units could be 2d6 (4d20). Those that prefer smaller units might have 1d6 (3d10) or 1d8 (3d8). Overpowered monsters could have as little as 1 (2d6) for numbers. You might also decide a nightmare is a social creature, and lairs of them are very large, but chance encounters are limited, like so: 1d4 (6d10).
A slightly different idea you might have is to create a solitary creature that spawns other, smaller creatures -- one giant “boss monster” or surrounded by numerous, weaker mooks. This is fine, but remember that as long as the anchor stays intact, the nightmare realm can recreate any nightmares that are killed or destroyed. Only by removing or destroying the anchor does a nightmare incursion truly come to an end.

Example Immunities & Vulnerabilities
A monster could be either resistant or vulnerable. Resistant means it is either immune or only takes half damage from it. Vulnerable means it takes double damage, or, if the substance isn’t normally harmful (salt, sunlight, water, etc), this monster takes damage from it. Alternately, it might be resistant or vulnerable to a specific type of one of the things on this list:
- Acid and/or other corrosive substances.
- Attacks or spells cast by creatures of a specific alignment.
- Bad weather.
- Bladed or slashing weapons.
- Blood and/or bleeding.
- Blunt weapons and crushing effects.
- Cold and frost-based attacks.
- Confusion and/or stupidity.
- Crystals and glass.
- Curses and enchantments.
- Darkness and darkness-themed magic.
- Disease.
- Earth, rock, and stone.
- Emotions (anger, fear, joy, sadness, etc).
- Fire and heat.
- Gases and vapours.
- Healing magic (is more effective or deals damage instead).
- Hunger and thirst.
- Illusions (always believe them or can see through them).
- Insanity or madness.
- Life drain and necromantic magic.
- Light, radiance, and sunlight (or sunlight-themed magic).
- Lightning.
- Living plants, herbs, or spices.
- Magic.
- Magical detection and divination.
- Metal.
- Mirrors.
- Mundane weapons.
- Natural weapons and/or unarmed attacks.
- Paralytic effects (magical or poison).
- Petrification.
- Piercing weapons.
- Plants or wood (living or dead).
- Poisons, toxins, and venom.
- Powers that affect the mind.
- Sound and vibrations.
- Wood or other dead plant material.

Example Presence Effects
Presence effects are pervasive aspects of a creature’s nature. They happen whether it attacks or not, although they always have a fairly definite range, and can be countered if the proper measures are taken. PCs should be able to save against the effects, either against their own attributes or against the monster’s, your call. If the monster is maintaining the effect consciously, the save should be against its attribute score. If the effect is unconscious, PCs should save against their own attribute scores.

Anti-Magnetism
Metal objects that come within 10 feet of this monster are pushed back with an invisible force. You must save against your Ferocity each round to defy this force.

Cause Fear 
When you see this monster, you must save against your Willpower or flee uncontrollably. Characters unable to feel afraid are immune to this effect.

Immobility Trap
When you touch this creature, you must save against your Intelligence or stay still for a round as it leeches part of your chronology for itself.

Painwaves
Within 20 feet of this monster, other creatures feel sharp needles of pain at regular or random intervals. When you are affected by this pain, you must save against your Willpower to maintain your concentration for any task that needs it.

Poison Cloud
When you breathe in the air around this creature, you must save against your Health or Willpower or lose 1d6 Health. Not breathing around it is probably not feasible, but wearing a wet cloth over your face gives you advantage on your save.

Shocking
When you touch this monster, you suffer it's hit die in lightning damage. Touching it with an item made of stone or wood bypasses this effect.

Spell Suction
When you get within 10 feet of this creature and you have spells memorized, you must save against your Willpower or you have a choice to make: lose a random spell or cast it immediately.

Veil of Darkness
This monster destroys light within 30 feet of itself. Light sources further away are not affected and it probably stays underground during the day.

Example Special Attacks
When a monster has a special attack, it takes a combat action to use. Some attacks it may not be able to use many times, or even more than once per fight. For most attacks, you roll for the monster to hit the PCs, although some automatically cause damage just like fighters do. When a special attack that does more than cause damage always hits, PCs should get a save against one of the monster’s attributes.

Bear Hug
This creature has two claw attacks. If both are successful in the same round, the monster grabs its target and crushes them, automatically dealing damage once in addition to attacking twice. It cannot attack other enemies once it has someone in a bear hug.

Chain Lightning
When this monster shoots a bolt of lightning, it makes an attack roll against the target’s Dexterity score. With a successful hit, the monster may attack a second target that is within 10 feet of the first. This may continue as long as the monster keeps scoring successful hits or runs out of targets. Chain lightning may not attack the same target twice during a single attack.

Hallucinatory Foe
This creature can cause an enemy to attack an illusion they perceive as a threat, unless they can save against their own Intelligence. Maintaining a number of illusions up to its level occupies the creature for the entire round.

Mind Blast
This monster telekinetically bludgeons a number of intelligent foes up to its level. Foes targeted must save against their Willpower or suffer its Hit Die in damage.

Poison Blade
This monster wields a sword coated in poison. When you are hit, if you fail to save against the poison, the damage bypasses your Disposition and reduces your Health.

Slime Catapult
This creature produces a globule of slime and hurls it up to a hundred feet (as long as there are high ceilings). If you roll the creature’s Dexterity or lower on a d20, the globule hits the intended target, and anyone else within 5 feet, all of whom suffer its HD in damage from the corrosive slime. If you roll higher, the sack lands 3d6 feet away in a random direction.

Spine Blossom
This creature shakes violently, sending spines shooting out in all directions. It makes a separate attack roll against everyone within 30 feet, though it deals only 1d4 damage on a successful hit.

Beyond the Lair
Most nightmare creatures cannot leave their incursions and exist in the mortal realm, but there are 3 ways this very thing may happen.
Firstly, they can be summoned by wizards, the same way other extraplanar creatures are brought to this world. Depending on the magic used, a nightmare might be given physical form, allowed to possess a mortal host, or allowed only mental contact with the wizard. Certainly, physical access is not guaranteed, just because a magic spell has been cast, but even mental contact may allow the nightmare world to seize an anchor and build an incursion around it.
Secondly, the nightmare curses that linger with even those who have escaped an incursion are actual creatures of nightmare, living inside their human hosts. They can do nothing but enact their curse, unless they are exorcised -- in which case they assume physical form as a Level 1 nightmare creature.
And lastly, it is possible for some Level 1 nightmare creatures to leave their incursions for short periods of time, but only at night, in the dark. They might do so in order to terrorize people, collect worshippers, or to obtain a new anchor from the possession of some miserable person, dying in torment, and thus create a new incursion. They can also leave in the form of nightmare curses, but in that form, the only thing they can do is maintain the curse, unless they are exorcised and returned to physical form.
Nightmares of higher levels are unable to exist in the world physically because their nightmare essence is not diluted enough. Only the lowest level of nightmare is close enough to the world to live within it for any amount of time at all. A wizard might provide a host body to a nightmare of a higher level, perhaps, but it would have to carry its own incursion around with it, either inside itself, or like a halo around it, which is not their normal mode of operation.

Dungeon Deaths
When a PC dies inside a nightmare incursion, if you do not know enough about their fears and past experiences, ask one or more of the following questions.
- What are your final thoughts as you die, and what parts of your life flash before your eyes?
- What did no one ever understand about you and the pains in your soul?
- What do you regret most about dying in this dungeon?
- What do you wish had never happened to you?
- What great hopes and dreams die with you?
- What is your most cherished possession, and why?
- What was the greatest mistake of your life?
- Who are you leaving behind?
- Who do you blame for this untimely end?
- Who do you think will miss you when you don’t come back?
- Who do you wish you had taken vengeance upon? What did they do to you?

Take the answers they give you and create new nightmare creatures and incursions from them. If they leave valuable items behind, the nightmare realm can turn these into anchors, though it does not need to create an anchor in order to use these other thoughts and experiences as nightmare fuel.

There And Back Again
If you want to be able to find your way back to a location in the wilderness that you have found, with no chance of getting lost along the way, you can learn the route by solidifying the location in your memory. This requires a scene that connects your character to some aspect of the location -- either a confession or a flashback.
If you do not have your own knowledge of a location in the wilderness, forged through a confession or a flashback, having been there before is no guarantee of arriving safely or in a timely manner the next time you travel, even if you have mapped your way there and back. You must still make orienteering rolls.
Including other characters in your confessions or flashbacks, by confessing to them, or telling them of your flashback, gives them the knowledge of the route as well. They will not need to make their confessions or narrate their own flashbacks in order to find it again.

Confessions
To make a confession, you must reveal something of your character’s inner life to the GM and the other players. They could make this confession to a companion, write it in a journal, or simply mull it over in their own head. Your confession must reveal negative aspects of your character’s life, experiences, or feelings. You may confess any of the following:
- Your antisocial desires.
- Your criminal plans.
- Your fears.
- Your regrets.

The place whose location you want to remember must be the inspiration for this confession. Perhaps these surroundings inspire fear inside your heart, or cause you to reflect on the selfish motivations that led you to seek them out. Or perhaps you and your companions discuss the vengeance you will all be able to have once you loot the treasures buried here.
You can draw upon what you already know about your character, or decide on new details on the fly. You are not required to discuss or reveal anything your character has actually done in the past (that’s what flashbacks are for), just what they think or feel.

Flashbacks
To have a flashback, you must describe an event, or a series of events, from your character’s history, and how they relate to this location. It could be the event that caused your character to find this place, or what is reputed to be here. It could be something that happened when they were here before, even if it is not what brought them back. It could simply be an event that occurred in a similar place, however far away, that your character is only now remembering.
Events in a flashback must be disturbing, stressful, traumatic, or otherwise able to conjure negative emotions in your character. You are not required to describe how your character felt at the time or how this memory makes them feel now (that’s what confessions are for), but you may, if you like. You can flash back to any of the following:
- An assault, crime, or violation you were the victim of.
- A betrayal, crime, or trespass you committed.
- A disturbing event you participated in.
- A disturbing event or phenomenon you witnessed.
- A disturbing phenomenon you experienced.
- A time when you learned things you would rather not know.
- A time when you lost control of yourself.

As with confessions, the place whose location you want to remember must be the inspiration for your flashback, and you can keep it to yourself or share it with your companions, whichever you like, as long as the GM knows what happened.
If you don’t yet know the details of your character’s past, you can invent whatever you think is appropriate. If you’ve already revealed details, take care not to contradict them when you describe new ones.

Nightmares in the Wild
Out in the wilderness, where a person is all alone, things are different. With so few people around, the nightmares can hear your fears and your regrets more clearly. They do not need to wait until you die before they steal the darkness inside you.
When you use a confession or a flashback in order to learn the way to a location in the wilds, the nightmare realm can use that information to build new nightmares, and new nightmare incursions.
Anything that is part of a confession or flashback is something that you, the GM, can use as nightmare fuel. Unlike when a PC dies inside an incursion, however, you can only use the experience, thoughts, and memories that they revealed in the confession or flashback, but not any of their other experiences which may have been revealed at other times.

Inside an Incursion
The inside of an incursion is also much like the wilderness -- your impressions and emotional reactions to the dungeon can be turned into more nightmares. These are not usually very useful, because they are rarely new. Inside an incursion, the PCs tend to be fighting nightmares, after all.
Even so, you can ask the PCs some of these questions while they are inside an incursion, and use the results to create nightmares:
- What are you afraid of?
- What do you hope isn't waiting for you in the dungeon?
- What, or who, does this dungeon remind you of?
- What sort of creature do you think was responsible for what you see here?
- What terrible monster do these noises make you think of?
- What would you leave this dungeon, even after all you have seen already?

Running A Nightmare Incursion
As the PCs explore the dungeons of the nightmare world and its corrupted outposts -- and, frankly, anywhere else they go that is extremely dangerous -- they encounter numerous threats and difficulties. When they move through civilization, you play the game in short scenes, where the PCs interact with other characters, even fighting them if they so desire, or in montage sequences, where they buy new gear, lounge about in hospitals, and discover they are broke and must again face the challenge of robbing the nightmare realm. But inside the dungeons of their foes, in the fortresses of the corrupted, and out in the chaos of the blighted wilderlands, things are different. In these dangerous and unfamiliar areas, you track the movements of the PCs constantly, staying with them every minute -- because every minute inside a nightmare incursion is a chance to lose your life, or your mind trying not to.

Fixed Encounters
The most important feature of dungeon exploration is the map. You already have a fully-detailed map that remains a mystery to the players, with your monsters, traps, and other things placed on it. Whenever the PCs move to a location where one of those dangers lies, they must deal with it or flee, lest they fall under its power.
The fixed encounters for a specific dungeon, lair, or other location are all known to you before you begin the adventure. The seven main types include: the anchor, the crown, dangers, other monsters, other treasures, special features, and traps. Any other features you have included on the map are also fixed encounters.

The Anchor
Any PC who sees or touches an anchor knows what it is immediately. Just like they can withstand the madness that incursions cause in normal people, just like they can tell where an incursion begins and where it ends, they know an anchor when they find it. This doesn’t necessarily mean that an incursion will flaunt its anchor, just that it can’t be hidden.

The Crown & Other Monsters
There should be a predetermined number of the crown, equal to its lair numbers, placed on the map as fixed encounters. Because the crown is a nightmare creature, these encounters are always hostile.
Other monsters also appear in lair numbers, placed on the map in one large group or several smaller groups. These monsters have some sort of arrangement with the nightmares, which may or may not be obvious to intruders.

Other Treasures
If there are other valuable items in an incursion, aside from the anchor, they are there because of other monsters, or because NPCs brought them in. As such, they are probably in the possession of those other monsters, but if the nature of the dungeon calls for treasure in specific locations -- around the necks of sacrificed humans, buried under refuse, or placed before idols, for example -- place them where it seems most sensible.

Special Features & Traps
Other aspects of an incursion’s environment exist either because they have been placed intentionally by the nightmare realm or other monsters, or are incidental features of the negative experiences that were used to create the dungeon. Traps should be effective defences against intruders, placed intentionally to do so, but dangers pose a threat to everyone, even the nightmares. Other special features might be advantageous only to nightmares, but it is usually more interesting to make features that can be turned against the monsters by clever, lucky, or resourceful PCs.

Random Encounters
The second danger that the PCs face from both nightmare incursions and corrupted outposts are the nihilistic forces of chaos and entropy. Random accidents occur all too frequently in such deadly, stressful environments. Equipment breaks. Spells fail. 
Torches go out prematurely. Wandering monsters wander just a little too close. And always, at every moment, the nightmares are coming to get you.

The Encounter Die
Every lair has an encounter die: one die of a size between a d4 and a d12. When the PCs explore a nightmare incursion or other dangerous place, you roll this die to determine when the nightmares attack and if they encounter any other troubles.
You roll the encounter die at regular intervals while the PCs explore, and also to determine how long until the next attack by an incursion’s crown.

If a dungeon is... \ If a wilderness area is... \ Encounter Die
-\-\-
Busy or small \ Adjacent to an incursion \ d6
Large & not crowded \ Near an incursion \ d8
Mostly empty or quite huge \ Not near an incursion \ d10

The base size of the encounter die should be modified by circumstances, especially if an incursion’s anchor is either worth very little or is especially valuable.

Level \ Expected Value
-\-
1 \ 500 - 1000
2 \ 1000 - 2000
3 \ 2500 - 5000
4 \ 4000 - 8000
5 \ 5000 - 10,000
6 \ 6000 - 12,000
7 \ 15,000 - 30,000
8 \ 20,000 - 40,000
9+ \ 25,000 - 50,000

Increase the die size by 1 if...
- The anchor of the lair is worth less than the expected value, based on its level.
- There are many empty rooms or spaces in this lair that require exploring.
- This lair is already heavily stocked with dangerous fixed encounters.
- You want to make this lair slightly less dangerous to explore.

Reduce the die size by 1 if...
- The anchor of the lair is more valuable than the expected range, based on its level.
- This lair has relatively few fixed encounters.
- This lair has only nightmares in it and no other monster.
- You want to make this lair somewhat more dangerous.

When to Roll the Encounter Die
Periodically, you must check to see if the PCs encounter a wandering monster.
These monsters might be attracted by light or noise, they might be able to smell the intruders, or they might simply be travelling through the same space at the same time.
Random encounters are possible anywhere there are monsters, corrupted humans, or people antagonistic to the PCs, not just inside nightmare incursions.
When the PCs are actively exploring a dangerous area, roll the encounter die whenever...:
- The PCs cause a commotion or make a ruckus.
- The PCs enter a new area (that has no fixed encounter) for the first time.
- The PCs undertake a task that lasts about a turn (searching an area, picking a lock, etc).

When the PCs are actively exploring a nearly empty dungeon area, or they are staying put and being inconspicuous, roll the encounter die once per hour. Ignore the light tax result and instead reduce light sources normally, by the hour. Magical enchantments only end if the PCs are in a nightmare incursion; otherwise ignore this result also.
When the PCs are hiding in a secure area or exploring empty wilderness, roll the encounter die once each day and each night, ignoring every result save an encounter.
Light sources should be depleted normally, by the hour.

Defining “An Area”
An area is a deliberately nebulous concept. Any section of the dungeon devoted to a similar purpose, or containing an additional threat, can be considered a single area.
Additional threats in different rooms should be considered different areas. A series of similar rooms (connecting bedrooms, jail cells, or a few connecting hallways) should be considered a single area. You shouldn’t be able to interact with two separate areas at once unless you stand directly on the threshold between them.

Entering the Dungeon
You must also roll the encounter die when the PCs first enter an incursion, but not to generate random encounters. You roll it to create a countdown (see page 302). Do not roll the encounter die for a random encounter when the PCs first set foot in the dungeon. Give them a few precious moments before the hell begins.

Encounters and Other Events
When you are called upon to check for an encounter, as determined by the criteria on the previous page, roll the encounter die and consult this table:

Roll \ Event
-\-
1 \ An encounter occurs: roll on the random encounter table.
2 \ Light sources are taxed 1 hour (in dangerous areas).
3 \ One ongoing magical enchantment ends (in an incursion).
4 \ A special event occurs, if there's any in this dungeon.
5+ \ No particular encounter or even occurs.

When an encounter occurs, it means a wandering monster is present. Roll on a wandering monster table to determine its type and follow the encounter rules.
The other events on this table allow you to ignore strict time-keeping in dangerous areas, where time can understandably crawl, stretch, and speed by like an arrow.
Instead, the encounter die will tell you when light sources are depleted.
When light sources are taxed, reduce available resources by 1 hour. This allows you to avoid tracking it while the PCs are actively exploring a dangerous area, and adds some uncertainty to such endeavours. Ignore this result when the PCs are in an area where you are not rolling for encounters more than once an hour.
When an ongoing magical enchantment ends, the nightmare realm snuffs it out.
This does not ruin magical items, though they might “turn off ” for a moment before reactivating. This does not mean you should ignore the normal durations of spells, as some are very short.
Special events are those unique to a particular dungeon, such as extreme dampness that ruins supplies, infectious disease, swarms of stinging insects, or toxic gases in the air. These environmental hazards can cause equipment to fail or even lower attribute scores. Not every dungeon needs to have its own special event, in which case, this result can be ignored.

Countdown to Nightmares
The final danger, and perhaps the most important one, is the attention of the nightmare realm itself. You cannot travel through it without facing the creatures it spawns. While it may be possible, through good luck and perhaps a bit of caution, to avoid any and all wandering monsters while you explore an incursion, the same cannot be said about the nightmares controlling it. They will always pursue you, no matter what.
When the PCs enter a nightmare incursion, roll the encounter die and record the result. This is the current countdown number. The lower the roll, the sooner the PCs will meet another nightmare creature.
Over the course of play, things will happen that cause the countdown number to be reduced. The actions and events that lower the countdown are not quite the same as those that attract the attention of wandering monsters.
Reduce the countdown number by 1 whenever one of these events happen inside the incursion…:
- A living creature dies or has one of their attributes reduced to zero.
- The PCs cause a commotion or make a ruckus.
- The PCs enter a new area for the first time.
- The PCs move to a different area while carrying the anchor, or any part of it.
- A person uses magic.

Carrying the anchor to a new area that has not been visited before reduces the countdown by 2. Making a ruckus by using magic also reduces the countdown by 2.
When the countdown is reduced to zero, nightmares appear, as if they were a wandering monster. They are always the crown of the present lair. Use chance encounter numbers, not lair numbers. These monsters are spawned out of the nightmare realm itself, so they do not have to arrive like people do. They can appear by coming right out of the walls, even.
When the encounter with these nightmares is over, with the PCs having escaped or destroyed their foes, roll the encounter die again and start a new countdown.
When the PCs move from one lair to another, do not re-roll the countdown until the current one is reduced to zero. Always roll the encounter die of whatever lair the PCs are currently in. If the PCs split the party, roll a different countdown for each group. When they meet up again, discard all but the lowest countdown number.
Do not show the countdown number to the players. Keep it secret.

The Growing Danger
The nightmare realm is no passive enemy. If its incursions are left unchecked, they quickly grow in size and danger. Every 2 weeks that a nightmare incursion persists after it has been discovered by the players, roll 1d6 for each of its lairs to see how they grow in power. Depending on the event triggered, it might become larger, or attract new monsters, or begin attacking humans who come too close, but inevitably it will become more and more dangerous -- and the reward for defeating it will not become more valuable.
Do not roll to increase the lairs of incursions the PCs have not yet discovered, even if you have their locations marked on your map. You should design your dungeons to be the way you want the players to first encounter them, and build on them only after that has happened.

1d6 \ Incursion Event
-\-
1 \ Antagonize humans
2 \ Attract monsters
3 \ Create new lair
4 \ Grow in size
5 \ Increase in level
6 \ Lure humans

If an incursion is a deathtrap dungeon, a monster horde, or a spawning pit, you may elect to roll on the custom table of the proper type, instead of the normal table.
Heretic temples, being the most chaotic and unpredictable, always use the normal incursion event table.

1d6 \ Deathtrap \ Horde \ Spawning Pit
-\-\-\-
1 \ Create new lair \ Antagonize humans \ Antagonize humans
2 \ Create new lair \ Attract monsters \ Antagonize humans
3 \ Grow in size \ Attract monsters \ Create new lair
4 \ Increase in level \ Create new lair \ Create new lair
5 \ Lure humans \ Grow in size \ Increase in level
6 \ Roll on normal table \ Increase in level \ Roll on normal table

If any lair in an incursion reaches Level 9, that whole incursion stops growing in power. Do not roll for any of its lairs again. Instead, it focuses its enmity on nearby humans. There is a 1 in 6 chance each week that this incursion destroys the nearest human settlement.
Once an incursion has destroyed the nearest human settlement, whether any of its lairs have reached Level 9 or not, it becomes “inactive” and stops getting more powerful. Perhaps it will fade away over time, leaving an empty wasteland behind it.
Or maybe the world sinks into a nightmare realm permanently, one small piece at a time. What becomes of an incursion after it becomes inactive is up to the GM, but unless an area has been cleansed by a character reaching Level 10 and retiring, there are always more incursions.

Antagonize Humans
If this is rolled for a Level 1 lair, it means that its monsters or nightmares have been venturing out into the world to attack and murder humans. The nearby area becomes dangerous and, at the very least, checking for wandering monsters at night is appropriate. People may be dragged back into the nightmare incursion after being attacked, or left where they lie. The nightmares may also steal valuable objects with the intention of turning them into anchors for new lairs.
Because only Level 1 nightmares can leave their incursions, if this is rolled for a lair of Level 2 or higher, it might mean that monsters other than nightmares are doing the antagonizing, or this lair can create a new Level 1 lair next to it. This new lair is then able to antagonize nearby humans, should its crown decide to do so.

Attract Monsters
A new type of monster arrives, or an existing type has its numbers increased. Choose or roll a monster and refer to its lair numbers to determine how many additional monsters now inhabit this lair.

Create New Lair
A new lair of a lower level manifests next to this one, or at least nearby. This lair has its own crown and anchor, the same as any other. This new lair is not dependent on the one that spawned it for survival. If possible, the crown should be drawn from the thoughts and memories of those who have died in the first lair.
Lairs of Level 1 are already the lowest level possible, so they cannot create new lairs. If this result is rolled for a Level 1 lair, it antagonizes nearby humans instead.

Growth in Size
This lair grows in size to encompass surrounding areas, or radically changes its interior layout (or both). New rooms and areas appear, which may be trapped, but do not come with new monsters. This lair may now have more entrances, and it will probably take longer to reach the anchor than it would have before.

Increase in Level
The level of this lair increases by 1. It gains a new element, which you can choose or roll for, but none of the existing monsters increase in level except the crown, which is always the same level as its lair. The crown should also gain an additional power, or lose a weakness if it has several, and a few more should be added to the map as fixed encounters. The anchor does not get any more valuable than it already is.

Lure Humans
This can mean either of two things. It could be that a large number of people have ventured into this nightmare incursion of late, meeting grisly fates or disappearing entirely. Or this lair has attracted a number of human cultists, intent on worshipping it or seeking a twisted form of enlightenment in the madness it causes.

Lairs Without Anchors
Once a lair’s anchor is destroyed or leaves the nightmare incursion, that lair fades away. Its crown is no longer able to manifest and assault people, its traps no longer work, and its rooms are no longer accessible by humans.
This can happen quickly or slowly, depending on who is still in the dungeon.
Once people have left an area in an anchor-less lair, they cannot go back -- unless it is their only way back out again. No one is ever trapped in a lair that loses its anchor.
When the nightmare realm recedes, it cannot take material things with it. Anything material still inside a lair when it disappears is either claimed by another nightmare incursion or is left behind in the waking world.
Other monsters that are not nightmares also lose access to lairs when their anchors are removed. They do not leave along with the receding nightmare realm, however, and may still stalk and kill humans they encounter. Creatures that rely on nightmares to magically animate them -- some golems and undead -- become inert once the nightmare lair vanishes.

Losing Contact with the World
If a dungeon loses all of its lairs that have entrances on the material plane, it can no longer be reached by normal people. Any lairs left inside it are cast adrift, pieces of the nightmare realm that have no purchase in the waking world. They must find new entrances in order to continue terrorizing the Kingdoms of Dreams.
This can easily befall tunnel incursions, if they do not have a solid passageway leading between their various lairs. By contrast, even when a hive incursion can be considered a collection of tunnel incursions, lairs disconnected from the waking world may reattach themselves via nearby lairs that still have functional entrances.
Because the lairs of a zone incursion each have their own access to the material plane, with less need for compact entrances, they are also the hardest to get rid of (but also the easiest to notice).

Evil’s Return
Just because an incursion has lost its entrance to the material world, or its connection to an entrance, does not mean that it no longer poses a threat. So long as an incursion contains an anchor, it can, and will, return.
Incursions can show up again through several means. The oldest and surest way is through the summonings of wizards. Usually, summoners are fishing for other entities -- ghosts, demons, spirits -- but sometimes they bring the nightmare realm closer, allowing it to snatch an anchor from the minds of those resentfully dying nearby. And sometimes, magic can even create new entrances to lairs that already have anchors.
Less common is for lairs to be called by emotions strong enough to rend the veils between the planes. This is more or less the same as being summoned, though it happens unconsciously or unintentionally, during a highly charged death. People who die in terrible ways can give themselves over to the nightmare realm and live on -- in a sense -- through the incursion that is built around their pain and suffering and the anchor that was once in their possession. It is much easier for nightmares to steal memories and experiences like this when they have already established a foothold in the area, however. Like calls to like, after all.
There are also certain cursed objects that can work to manifest new nightmare incursions around themselves. Anchors and most mundane objects cannot be used by the nightmare realm in such a way -- and anchor removed is a lair destroyed. Only magical items can call the nightmare realm into the world. Even mundane anchors are powered by a person’s experience of them, not by their inherent qualities.
The usual way of reconnecting to the material world, however, is for lairs to simply attach themselves to other incursions that have not lost their entrances. This is one way for dungeons to grow and alter themselves. As they lose lairs to persistent intruders, smaller dungeons blink out of existence, their contents added to other dungeons.
A single tunnel dungeon, cut off from the world, may attach itself to another tunnel dungeon, creating a new hive incursion. Or it might attach itself to a hive incursion already in operation, making it more complex. Because tunnel incursions and hive incursions are more contained and interior than zone incursions, they do not often mix. Instead, if they attach to a zone incursion’s lair, that lair becomes a de facto part of the tunnel or hive incursion -- usually the new entrance.

What Lurks in Darkness
There are seven types of monsters described here:
- Beastlings include normal animals, corrupted or magical animals, and people with beast-like features. Centaurs, giant worms, griffins, lycanthropes, manticores, mermaids, minotaurs, monstrous oozes, owlbears, and serpent people are all examples of beastlings.
- Dwellers in the deep are beings from far-away and hostile environments -- alien gods, demons, undersea leviathans, and creatures from beyond time and space. Some are skilled at wearing masks to appear human, in order to manipulate people, while others do not understand this world and break every part of it they touch.
- Faeries also come from another dimension or plane of existence, but one that overlaps the material world. The seelie court consists of dryads, dwarves, elves, gnomes, nixies, sprites, treants, and other such majestic creatures. The unseelie court includes goblins, mushroom people, ogres, orcs, and trolls. Both courts worship dragons, just as humans worship pagan gods.
- Golems are monsters created from inert materials and given a magical life, so that they behave like people or animals in many ways, but not all. Animated shadows, clockwork automatons, living statues, and terrible abominations made of corpses are examples of golems. Golems are always immune to disease and poisons, and those without emotions are also immune to mind control and psychic powers.
- Humans are usually not “monsters,” but they can be corrupted by nightmares and other forces, and they can also act as antagonists to a party of would-be dungeon looters.
- Nightmares are creatures from the nightmare realm, but whether they are actually individuals or just manifestations of the realm itself and its incursions is unknown. All nightmares can see in the dark, are immune to disease, mind control, and poison, and suffer double damage from light-based and radiance attacks (but not lightning).
- The undead are once-living beings who have died and been returned to some semblance of life. They might be animated corpses (much like golems), intangible ghosts, or beings that seem almost human, but for whom a few key rules have been changed. The undead are always immune to disease and poisons, and mindless undead are always immune to mind control.

You may add more types of monsters, if you like, or ignore some of those included here. Just make sure PCs don’t have spiritual enemies that never appear in your dungeons.

Abductors
It waits in the darkness, pruning its brilliant plumage, the old man smell seeping out of its old man beard. Its hands hold you like a child. And perhaps you were, once, but those hands took that away from you. Just as these hands will take you away from here.

Level 1 chaotic nightmares.
Armour 13, Hit Die 1d8, Morale 0, Numbers 1 (2d4), Size Large, Speed 8 (moves 16 in flight), Surprise -1. Cha 0, Dex 14, Fer 12, Hth 0, Int 12, Wil 8.
1 unarmed attack per round.
- Half damage from slashing weapons.

The entire purpose of the abductors is to force humans into the nightmare realm. If the abductor reduces an NPC to zero Disposition, they are rendered helpless, not killed. A PC who is wounded (i.e. losing points of Health) by an abductor has a 50/50 chance of being knocked unconscious. An abductor can carry up to 2 people and still fly back to its incursion, where it deposits the unfortunate victims.
A nightmare incursion that includes abductors as the crown of any of its lairs dispatches abductors to kidnap locals at least once per week, in addition to any other ways it grows in size or power.

Adepts of the Flame
Before the assassins of the fire cult were slain by the sultan’s soldiers, their reign of terror was long and bloody. They fed the nightmares well. Now they hunt the night again, but not, this time, as men. With faceless bodies made of sparkling gore, they have tentacles for fingers, wear pristine white robes, and wield swords made of fire.

Level 3 evil nightmares.
Armour 14, Hit Die 1d8, Morale +3, Numbers 1d4+1 (3d4+1), Speed 10, Surprise -1.
Cha 0, Dex 12, Fer 16, Hth 0, Int 6, Wil 10.
1 flaming sword attack each round as a fighter.
- Double damage from acid.
- Immune to fire.

If an adept of the flame's attack roll succeeds, the victim has a 50/50 chance of catching on fire, if they are at all flammable. Characters on fire can spend a complicated combat action to extinguish the flames, but they must save against their Dexterity. Otherwise, they suffer an additional 1d4 damage each round from the fire.

Blackbirds
Not as fearsome as the mighty roc, but far more devious, the sly blackbird has brought many a traveller to ruin. Keep a hand on your valuables at all times when you go through the mountains, my friend, and even then, always look to the skies above. For if the blackbird is even bigger than you are, it might not care that you are holding your treasures when it snatches them up!

Level 3 neutral beastlings.
Armour 13, Hit Die 1d6, Morale 0, Numbers 1 (1d6), Speed 8 (moves 16 flying),
Surprise -1. Cha 8, Dex 14, Fer 8, Hth 12, Int 16, Wil 8.
1 beak attack per round, or 1 attempt at theft.
* Double damage from acid, poison, and silver weapons.
* Half damage from blunt weapons.
* Immune to lightning.

If the blackbird saves against its Dexterity, it can snatch an item at any point during its movement, even while flying. If someone of higher level is guarding the item, the blackbird must save against half its Dexterity score. If the roll is failed, it can stop moving and take hold of the object, or leave it and flee.

Treasures
If properly plucked and mounted, the feathers of a blackbird can be fashioned into a beautiful cape, robe, or tunic that functions as light armour, but is not encumbering.
Blackbirds are inveterate thieves. If you can follow one back to its nest, there is always treasure there. But beware, for these birds do not always nest alone! Roll 1d6 to determine how much treasure is found in a blackbird’s nest:

1d6 \ Treasure
-\-
1 \ 1 valuable item worth 1d6 x500$, and various worthless shiny things
2 \ 1 valuable item worth 1d10 x50$, and various worthless shiny things
3 \ 1d6 valuable items worth 1d6 x200$ each, and a few worthless curios
4 \ 1d6 valuable items worth 1d10 x50$ each, and some junk
5 \ Small items worth 1d6 x1000$ in total, totalling 1d6 encumbering items
6 \ Small items worth 1d10 x100$ in total, totalling 1d6 encumbering items

The Cavemurdered
They entered the cave for the thrill of discovery, to achieve what had never been done before. Each one desired to out-do the others, and all who came before. What perilous adventures would they find in those horrid depths? It was death. By the flickering light of their torches, with the smoke stinging their eyes like the wild beasts stinging their flesh, they too were extinguished. Having fallen awkwardly, broken and mangled, feeling the life drain away in the dark, they too discovered what it is like to be murdered to death in a cave by a monster.

Level 2 evil nightmares.
Armour 13, Hit Die 1d6, Morale +3, Numbers 1d6 (3d6), Speed 7, Surprise 0.
Cha 0, Dex 10, Fer 16, Hth 0, Int 12, Wil 12.
Skills: Climbing, dungeoneering, swimming.
1 torch attack and 1 snake attack per round.
* Double damage from cold and frost-based attacks.
* If its torch is extinguished, a cavemurdered is destroyed along with the fire.

If the snake attack hits, the target must save against their Health or the paralytic venom lowers their Dexterity score instead of inflicting damage.

Claustrophobia
Whatever the incursions of the cavemurdered look like at first, they quickly transform into cramped cave tunnels, full of bats and crawling bugs, when these nightmare creatures arrive. Lights flicker, and smells become more vivid. The claustrophobia that accompanies the cavemurdered is punishingly intense, and whatever you are carrying seems to grow heavier and heavier.
When there is one or more cavemurderd within 20ft of you, any encumbering items not held loosely in your hands count double toward your limit.
This includes shields and sheathed weapons, as well as armour and backpacks, but not weapons while they are wielded.

Serpents of Vengeance
Each cavemurdered holds 1d4+1 snakes that it can attack with once per round. When a cavemurdered is destroyed, these snakes remain and continue to be a nuisance to adventurers.

Level 1 evil nightmares.
Armour 11, Hit Die 1d4, Morale 0, Size Tiny, Speed 6, Surprise -1.
Cha 0, Dex 10, Fer 10, Hth 0, Int 6, Wil 6.
1 bite attack per round.

Unattached to a cavemurdered, a snake’s bite is no longer venomous. It is also shorter than any human weapon. Snakes die if they take any amount of damage at all.

Skulls
The head of a cavemurdered is an actual human skull, kept by the nightmare realm as a memento mori, and given a body in order to collect more. When a cavemurdered is destroyed, its skull remains, and can be used again to create a new cavemurdered if it is not destroyed or removed from the incursion. Each skull is worth 100c, and can be used to reduce the cost of creating formulas for death-based spells by 1d4 × 200c each, if properly distilled (save against your Intelligence to do so).

Crab-Dogs
Is it really a surprise that mages and sorcerers would seek out the nightmare realm on purpose? The insights to be gained from worlds beyond the stars is well nigh endless. It is not without dangers, though, of course not. For every wizard who sleeps at night upon a mountain of gold there are a dozen who were devoured by their own creations!

Level 2 chaotic beastlings.
Armour 12, Hit Die 1d6, Morale 0, Numbers 2d4 (4d8), Speed 8, Surprise +1.
Cha 0, Dex 12, Fer 14, Hth 12, Int 4 (14), Wil 8.
Skills: Track by scent.
1 bite attack per round (or 2 claw attacks, see below).
* Dispel Magic and Remove Curse both cause 1d6 damage to nearby crab-dogs.
* Double damage from desiccation effects.

If you are attacked by a crab-dog and its attack roll against your Armour rating is 11 or higher, it can hold on by its mouth and attack you with its claws twice per round. If a crab-dog suffers harm, it lets go, or you can detach it pro-actively if you save against your Ferocity.
Crab-dogs have senses made for alien environments. When it comes to mundane people, places, and things, they are myopic and oblivious (Intelligence 4), but they can sense magical things and deep sea creatures from far away (Intelligence 14). If you have no magic in your party, you have advantage to surprise crab-dogs.

Eclipse Wolf
Not even the abyss can could contain this fiend from beyond the stars. Known to a mere handful of arcanists, the Eclipse Wolf gallops through the cosmos at terrible speeds, never stopping and rarely slowing down. As a testament to its otherworldly nature, the white fur that covers this monster’s hide is never sullied by the dust of the worlds, or the blood of the victims, it tramples upon.

Level 7 chaotic dweller in the deep.
Armour 13, Hit Die 1d8, Morale +1, Numbers 1, Size Large, Speed 8 (moves 12),
Surprise 0. Cha 0, Dex 16, Fer 20, Hth 20, Int 20, Wil 20.
Skills: Running.
1 bite attack as a fighter (against a single target), or 1 charge attack (against up to 7 targets) every round.
* Double damage from fire and light-based attacks.
* Immune to disease, mind control, poison, and magical effects that create emotions other than fear and rage.
* Suffers 1d6 damage each round it is exposed to (magical) sunlight.

If the Eclipse Wolf ’s bite attack hits, it can hold the target in its jaws and subsequent bite attacks against the same target automatically hit. Escape requires a save against Ferocity and a complicated combat action.
Wherever the Eclipse Wolf goes, the sun is blotted out by a gigantic, blazing black disc that is oppressively hot and causes the air to vibrate silently. The Eclipse Wolf vomits grey-black lightning attuned to the same frequencies, which turns them into a visual representation of the effect of sound, which also disrupts human cognition.
Each round you gaze upon the eclipse wolf, you must save against your Willpower or lose 1d4 points of Intelligence.

Interplanar Movement
The (or an, if there is more than one) Eclipse Wolf enters the Earthly plane, and leaves it, at any of the following types of locations:
* Battle sites where the defeated side’s fighters were executed in the field.
* Nightmare incursions.
* Pagan temples that have been destroyed and not repurposed by non-believers.
* Sites where powerful otherworldly beings were summoned in the past.

Constituents
The slain body of an Eclipse Wolf rots much like a human animal, only 5 times as fast, and its flesh eventually degrades into a highly-flammable, poisonous gel.
There is also 1d8 × 1,000c worth of molten gold inside its bones (instead of marrow), and its brain is made of a softly-glowing crystal that grants someone holding it advantage to the casting of Illusion spells.

False Children
When the little ones began to go missing, it was all we could do to keep our community together. But then some of us bought weapons and ventured into the underground, to see if we could find them. And we did. We found them, alright… and so much more.

Level 2 chaotic nightmares.
Armour 13, Hit Die 1d6, Morale 0, Numbers 1d8 (3d10), Size Small, Speed 5,
Surprise -1. Cha 12, Dex 12, Fer 6, Hth 0, Int 16, Wil 12.
1 limb attack per round.
* Half damage from mundane weapons.

At first, they look like children, often taking the appearance of specific children who have died or gone missing in the area around the incursion. They speak like children, too, often cautiously, as if they might not trust the ones they address. But then monstrous limbs sprout from their bodies -- thick tentacles, misshapen arms, clawed hands, thrashing spider legs, the claws of crustaceans, scorpion stingers, and other such terrible things. They are usually very long, even in excess of six feet or so.
When they are attacked or hurt, they cry like children do. If they fail a morale test, they run and hide, crying softly like children. If they are found crying, they attack again, but with Morale +4.
When you destroy a false child, you automatically fail the next roll you make, unless this magical effect is dispelled or otherwise protected against. Observers feel the need to laugh and mock you unless they, too, are protected from the enchantment.

Frostlings
When the snow comes, so too do the elves of winter. They'll freeze you in your tracks, out in a storm. He'll carry you off to their caves made of ice, to dine on your flesh and make bread from your bones. Keep those fires lit if you want to be among the living when the spring returns.

Level 2 evil faeries.
Armour 17, Hit Die 1d6, Morale +2, Numbers 1d6 (3d8), Speed 10, Surprise -1.
Cha 10, Dex 12, Fer 12, Hth 10, Int 14, Wil 10.
Skills: Butchery, sculpture, and singing are their most common talents.
1 weapon attack as fighter per round, bonus damage is paralysis.

Frostlings attack as normal humans against fiery creatures (no attack bonus).
* Double damage from fire and lightning.
* Half-damage from acid.
* Immune to cold and poison.

Frostlings are elven nobles of the unseelie court, intimately connected to the nightmare world. Their physical form in this world is primarily composed of humans’ experiences while dying of exposure. They are constantly surrounded by bitter cold and swirling crystals of snow. They wear the idealized faces of your loved ones beneath frost-rimed iron armour and wield swords made of ice. It is impossible to be surprised by frostlings when normal temperatures are above freezing, but in the cold, you suffer a -2 penalty to notice them before they surprise you, because they move silent and slow.
When you are attacked by a frostling, you lose Disposition automatically, but if you suffer bonus damage, it comes off your Dexterity instead of your Disposition.
If you lose half your Dexterity or more in one round, you are paralysed for the next 1d6 rounds. When your Dexterity is reduced to zero, you are paralysed for 1d6 hours, after which you regain 1 point. Frostlings that paralyse a foe move on to the next until there is no one left to fight, then each frostling carries one random victim away with them.
Frostling armour cannot be worn by humans, but each suit is decorated with icy gemstones worth 1d10 × 10 cyphers to humans (who do not understand them well), and much more to unseelie faeries. The powdered flesh of frostlings can be used to gain advantage when casting spells that deal with cold and frost. Each body yields 2d4 uses of such powder.

Glass Thieves
Down Dagger Alley, just off Lantern Way, in the basement of an unassuming hat shop, the thieves’ guild built their headquarters. But when their members robbed the wealthiest merchant in the land of his exquisite imported glassware, the guild fell prey to jealousy and greed. After the back-stabbing, both literal and figurative, ended, none were spared the knife or the poison trap. The neighbourhood knew peace and safety until another gang moved in, and the shop’s basement became the site of a nightmare incursion.
Though dead, the spirits of these criminals live on in the form of glass, never again to leave their old hideout. Those that enter, in search of loot, also never leave…

Level 1 evil nightmares.
Armour 15, Hit Die 1d6, Morale +1, Numbers 1d6 (3d6), Speed 9, Surprise +1.
Cha 0, Dex 16, Fer 12, Hth 0, Int 8, Wil 10.
Skills: Burglary and theft.
1 crystal knife attack and 1 grab attempt per round.
* Double damage from blunt weapons and cold-based magical attacks.
* Half damage from cutting weapons.
* Immune to acid and piercing weapons.

With the face of a smiling young man made of glass on a lithe, stringy body dressed in black, a glass thief wields a knife made of crystal, slashing intruders to ribbons.
Though they were once stealthy robbers, their glass bodies scrape along the stone floors of their lair, giving their presence away to those listening carefully. For every 5 thieves encountered, one is a Level 2 guild leader (whose orders are not obeyed).
When harmed, their bodies shatter and shards of glass poke through their clothes, giving glass thieves advantage to any subsequent damage rolls they make.
In addition to attacking with their crystal knives, glass thieves will attempt to steal a piece of equipment that a foe has but isn’t holding in their hand. To steal an item from someone of their level or lower, you must roll the glass thief ’s Dexterity or less on a d20.
If their level is higher than the glass thief, you must roll half their Dexterity or less on a d20. Once a glass thief has snatched an item, he runs away with it, deeper into the dungeon.

Knives in the Back
Crystal knives can be sold for 10 cyphers each, although a day of owning one is the same as an hour inside a nightmare incursion for the purposes of developing a nightmare curse. PCs are immune to this property, normal people (who might buy one of these curios) are not. These knives can also allow nightmares to create a new incursion around them.

Hive Mothers
Many-handed wings like the black of night spread out across her body. Clutching her dead children, she is swallowed by darkness. Everyone dies alone, in the end.

Level 4 evil nightmares.
Armour 13 (16 vs. missile attacks), Hit Die 1d6, Morale +3, Numbers 1d4 (2d6),
Size Large, Speed 9, Surprise 0.
Cha 0, Dex 8, Fer 12, Hth 0, Int 14, Wil 10.
1 bite attack as a fighter (1d8 damage) or 1-4 imp attacks (1d4 damage) per round.
* Half damage from blunt weapons and non-magical missile attacks.
* Immune to firearms.

Hive mothers can send up to 4 imps to attack foes up to 30 feet away. 1 imp may be released per round; they count as Level 1 and die if they take any damage at all.
In order to fight a hive mother in close combat, you must be drawn into her wings. Anyone approaching a hive mother has their movement rate and initiative score divided by the number of people who are already inside her wings (unless there are none). If your initiative score, after being divided, is lower than 1, you are unable to act for the round.

Illuminators
After the mine shut down, those of us left here still went in, to scavenge what we could from the remaining deposits. But then the creatures came -- walking lamps like giant armadillos or snail-men. A glow that signalled death, they were, tearing people apart with a mouth like a saw blade. No one goes into the mine anymore.

Level 2 neutral dwellers in the deep.
Armour 16, Hit Die 1d10, Morale 0, Numbers 1d6 (2d6+2), Speed 8, Surprise 0.
Cha 0, Dex 12, Fer 12, Hth 12, Int 4, Wil 6.
1 bite attack per round.
* Cannot be set on fire, though they do burn.
* Double damage from lightning and radiance.
* Immune to damage from poisons, but not other effects.

The waves of the nightmare realm do not arrive upon our shores unmixed or pure. Instead, they pull many other things along in their wake. But how to tell the difference? With some creatures, it matters little whether they are contaminated by nightmares or not.
Illuminators are roughly humanoid in shape, with additional, smaller limbs between their arms and legs. Their backs are covered in thick armoured plates, while their fronts, or undersides, consist of a snail-like gelatinous tissue, glowing with bioluminescence, so the illuminator can see. Where a human would have a chest and face, an illuminator has a mouth surrounded by a myriad of too-human eyes. Inside this squishy mouth is a vicious, jagged-toothed radula, powerful enough to scrape off barnacles and crush them to bits.
When searching for food, illuminators hunch in on themselves, blocking their glowing tissues so they focus into tight beams that play over the ground before them. They prefer to eat animals, fungus, and mold, ignoring most types of vegetation aside from fruits and tubers. Their bioluminescence persists for 1d6 days after they die, even if these parts are extracted from the body.

Iridescent Globes
The madness of protoplasmic flesh, somehow contained within congeries of shimmering, iridescent globes. As each glowing sphere floats through the night air, images of a frothing, primal slime, writhing in the chaos of elsewhere, flicker inside them.

Level 1 chaotic dwellers in the deep.
Armour 15, Hit Die 1d4, Morale 0, Numbers 3d6 (5d8), Speed 12, Surprise +1.
Cha 0, Dex 14, Fer 6, Hth 12, Int 10, Wil 16.
Every 5 globes uses 1 magic power per round (see below).
* Immune to lightning, paralysis, and poison.
* Double damage from life drain and other necromantic attacks.

Iridescent globes are native to the nethermost outskirts of space and time, far beyond the world of nightmares, whose incursions they arrive alongside because they are simultaneously co-terminus with manifold other places and dimensions. They are not actively hostile as a rule, but their presence bends reality too much for the human mind to fathom. Each month the globes are left to roam a location, it changes enough to become unrecognizable by natives.
The globes have a group mind (of some sort), and act in concert. Every group of 5 globes gets 1 attack per round, which is always a magic power. Roll 1d6 to see what power each group of 5 has access to each round:

1d6 \ Power
-\-
1 \ Curse: -1 penalty to attack or resist the globes for 1 day (multiple curses are cumulative).
2 \ Disarm: One weapon that attacks the globes is transported 1d100 feet in a random direction. If unarmed, the entire attacker is transported (but not to a space already occupied).
3 \ Engulf: One target cannot act for 1d4 rounds.
4 \ Prismatic Spray: Hit die damage to a single target.
5 \ Rewind: One enemy re-experiences the last 10 minutes in reverse, in 10 seconds. This includes moving backwards and suffering any mental effects again (but not physical effects). Healing of wounds suffered in these minutes does not occur.
6 \ Visions from Beyond: Reduce Intelligence of one target by 1d6.

When globes are burst, they leave behind a sticky, wet residue. Collecting the residue of a group of iridescent globes reduces the cost to prepare a potion affecting time and space by 1d6 × 25 cyphers.

Lamprey Golems
Serpentine guards called up from the riverbed by the wizards they serve. Made of earth and water and magic, they are implacable foes.

Clay Lampreys
Level 2 neutral golems.

1 choking attack per round.
* Immune to fire and all mundane weapons.
* Silt lampreys are almost liquid, able to squeeze through incredibly small spaces.

Locust Butchers
When the locusts swarm, the crops we worked so hard for disappear. Before our very eyes, they are stripped from the land. We know what follows: famine and banditry. Those who grow weak from starvation will lose what little they have to those who resort to force before it is too late for them. But then the sultan’s men will come, with their scimitars, dispensing “justice.” You have a weapon? You must be a bandit. The penalty is execution. You have a bag of golden coins? They must be stolen. The penalty is execution. You have an animal that is still alive? Why have you not fed the hungry with it? We are hungry. The penalty is execution, and tonight the sultan’s butchers will not go hungry.

Level 3 evil nightmares.
Armour 16, Hit Die 1d8, Morale +3, Numbers 1d4 (2d6), Speed 8, Surprise 0.
Cha 0, Dex 16, Fer 16, Hth 0, Int 10, Wil 10.
2 sword attacks per round or create a cloud of smoke.
* Double damage from fire.
* Half damage from slashing weapons.
* Healing magic deals damage to locust butchers when used within 10 feet.

If a locust butcher’s attack hits, the target must save against their Willpower during the following round or cast off their most prized possession out of fear and guilt.
Everyone within 20 feet of a locust butcher suffers 1 point of damage every round as they starve to death at an accelerated rate (no save can prevent this), and any food within 20 feet also spoils immediately.

Cloud of Smoke
Instead of attacking, a locust butcher can cause a cloud of acrid smoke to burst forth from the ground beneath it. The smoke stays in place for 1d6 rounds and grows to encompass a sphere roughly 10 feet in diameter.
Anyone moving through the smoke must save against their Willpower or they emerge in a random direction, lose their remaining actions, and for the next round they act last in initiative order and suffer disadvantage to any attack or skill rolls they make.
Once a locust butcher has used this power once during an encounter, there is only a 1 in 6 chance every round that they can use it again.

Swarm of Locusts
When a locust butcher loses all of its Disposition, it explodes into a swarm of tiny locusts. This cloud of buzzing insects lasts for 1d6 rounds and infl icts disadvantage on any attack or skill rolls made within 30 feet of where the locust butcher was destroyed.

Poison Trees
From beyond the stars they came, transformed into grasping masses of roots on this plane of existence, their skin grown hard like bark, as if burned by the very air of this world. Inside they are a fleshy pulp that steams and hisses when exposed. Their leafless limbs may beat your flesh, but the portions of your soul they steal are what the sorcerers who summoned them were after.

Level 3 chaotic dwellers in the deep.

* Half damage from piercing attacks.
* Immune to fire and heat.
* Immune to mental attacks, which cause 1d4 damage to the attacker.

If you are struck by a poison tree’s branch, you must save against your Willpower or lose 1d6 points of Charisma and suffer a random change to your personality (1d10):

1d10 \ Change
-\-
1 \ You always act like you are angry now, even when calm or joyous.
2 \ You are disgusted by normal clothes and must wear something else.
3 \ You cannot cooperate with the authorities.
4 \ You cannot give compliments, only insults.
5 \ You cannot rest within sight of other people, if you know they are there.
6 \ You cannot speak coherent language.
7 \ You cannot stand cooked food.
8 \ You hate and fear all written language.
9 \ You refuse to interact with animals except to fight them.
0 \ You refuse to pay for things with money.

You return to normal when you recover these lost attribute points. The magical essence extracted by these attacks can be found inside the poison tree, the body of which is worth 2d20 × 10 cyphers to an alchemist or sorcerer.
A poison tree has 1d6 pustules attached to its “roots,” which can explode, causing everyone within a 10 foot radius to become drenched in corrosive slime that deals 1d6 damage (save against your Dexterity for half damage). Taking full damage also means there is a 1 in 6 chance of each piece of equipment you carry being ruined by corrosion (this includes armour). A poison tree will never explode pustules two rounds in a row.

Rittersnakes
They were fools to disturb the ruins that lie in the Valley of Serpents. The wars were over, they should have gone back to their homes beyond the Salt Sea. But now the foul beasts of the wastes have taken root inside the bodies of those foreign crusaders, riding them into battle against pilgrims and merchant caravans alike. If you must travel, ride a fast horse and carry a cure for venom!

Level 2 evil beastlings
Armour 18, Hit Die 1d8, Morale +1, Numbers 1d6 (3d6), Speed 8, Surprise 0.
Cha 4, Dex 16, Fer 12, Hth 8, Int 10, Wil 10.
1 bite or spit attack and 1 weapon attack per round.
* Double damage from cold and frost-based attacks.

A spit attack has a range of 30 feet. Spit venom burns exposed skin but is not poisonous unless injected into the bloodstream or ingested. If a rittersnake closes with a foe, it can bite with its head and attack with its body independently, even fighting 2 different opponents. Bite attacks are venomous: you must save vs. poison or the damage reduces your Health directly.

Den of Serpents
A rittersnake den is a foul-smelling place indeed.
If you fight a rittersnake near its den, or enter such a den, you must save vs. poison or suffer disadvantage to all of your rolls except damage until you get back where the air is fresher. Each pack of rittersnakes has a slightly different scent, and can be identified by it, if it doesn’t cause you to retch and gag.

Parasites
A rittersnake occupies the bodies of some other animal, after removing its head and hijacking its nervous systems.
It feeds this body with its own waste, until the body dies of poison and malnutrition. This parasitism only works with living or freshly-killed bodies, not those that have been dead for hours already.
If a group of rittersnakes should lose access to good arms and armour, and must make do with the bodies of lesser creatures, their Armour ratings get worse.

Shadows of Pain
Inky black silhouettes, memories of childhood traumas, emerge from the darkened corners of the room. The bullies, the beatings, the doctors and their “cures” -- it all comes back once you step inside the nightmare realm, even though you thought it was all in the past.

Level 1 evil nightmares.
Armour 13, Hit Die 1d6, Morale +1, Numbers 1d6 (3d6), Speed 7, Surprise -1.
Cha 0, Dex 10, Fer 12, Hth 0, Int 10, Wil 12.
1 weapon attack per round.
* Double damage from lightning.
* Half damage from other magical effects.
* Immune to mental and psychic attacks of all kind.

Roll 1d6 to see what kind of weapon each shadow wields:

1d6 \ Weapon Effect
-\-
1 \ Belt Blunt trauma and lacerations.
2 \ Hand saw Cutting damage.
3 \ Ice Cold damage, ranged attack.
4 \ Pen knife Piercing damage.
5 \ Rod Blunt trauma damage.
6 \ Syringe Injects a numbing coldness.

A shadow that wields ice may throw balls of ice up to 30 feet away, and a successful ranged attack does not immobilize the enemy. A shadow that wields a syringe does not grab its enemies, instead they must save against their Willpower or be immobilized for 1d4 rounds.

Silent Accusers
Their temple was a wonder to behold. Pilgrims flock to it in droves, driven on by superstitious yearning. But when the sultan seized it, in his bloodlust he was driven to feats of monstrous inhumanity. So many died there, butchered without mercy, and none who knew can forget. Some cannot even forgive themselves. But now the dead have returned.

Level 1 chaotic undead.
Armour 11, Hit Die 1d4, Morale +3, Numbers 2d6 (4d10), Speed 4, Surprise 0.
Cha 2, Dex 8, Fer 12, Hth 0, Int 8, Wil 4.
1 unarmed attack per round.
* Half damage from slashing weapons.
* Immune to piercing weapons.

Silent accusers have advantage to their attack rolls if any other silent accusers have already attacked their target this round. They always attack lawful people first, but no more than 8 can attack the same person at once.

Skull-Faced Fiends
He was killed in the reptile house. It drove her mad. She saw his skull on the end of a lizard, night after night. Dry scales reminded her of murder. She could hear that murderous voice, too, still speaking over the growling dog. Still telling her to leave so she wouldn’t get hurt. No, she could never forget that voice.

Level 1 chaotic nightmares.
Armour 12, Hit Die 1d6, Morale 0, Numbers 1d4+1 (2d8), Speed 8, Surprise -1.
Cha 12, Dex 12, Fer 8, Hth 0, Int 12, Wil 12.
1 claw attack per round.
* Double damage from lightning.
* Half damage from piercing weapons.

Skull-faced fiends prefer to sneak up on a party and whisper to the weakest looking among them -- the hirelings, porters, and torchbearers. They try to convince them to leave and abandon the others, promising them free passage out. They warn them of imminent attack and death at the hands of nightmares.
“Everyone is about to die, horribly,” they say. “Get out, while you still can.
We’ll let you leave, but only if you go now.”
When they do attack, they begin to stink like a den of reptiles. You can try to save against your Health each round, but until you succeed once, you suffer disadvantage to your attack and skill rolls because of the nauseating stench.
The anchor in a lair that has the skull-faced fi ends as its crown (and is Level 1) is always guarded by a single Lord of Fiends, who walks upright on human legs and wields a jagged sword or a rusty axe.

Lord of Fiends
Level 3 evil nightmare.
Armour 16, Hit Die 1d8, Morale +2, Numbers 1,
Speed 10, Surprise -2.
Cha 12, Dex 12, Fer 16, Hth 0, Int 12, Wil 12.
3 weapon attacks per round.
* Double damage from lightning.
* Immune to fire and piercing weapons.

Wounds caused by the Lord of Fiends always become infected. If they are not treated properly, they do not heal, and the victim loses 1 point of Health per day.

The Stalker
She drowned in the lake, she did. He wanted her jewel, you see. Had debts to pay. He tried to snatch it off her forehead, but it went badly. She took it down into the depths with her, and he never saw it again. Now she’s back, stalking the shoreline. Looking for vengeance.

Level 3 evil nightmare.
Armour 14, Hit Die 1d8, Morale +1, Numbers 1 (1d6+1), Speed 8, Surprise -1.
Cha 0, Dex 14, Fer 16, Hth 0, Int 12, Wil 10.
Skills: Climbing and swimming.
2 claw attacks per round or 1 flash of light.
* Double damage from desiccation effects.
* Half damage from cold and frost-based attacks.

Instead of attacking, the stalker can cause the jewel on her forehead to flash and blaze. Those facing her (but no more than 6, total) lose 1d6 points of Intelligence and burning eyes that see threatening shapes even hours after. There is only a 1in4 chance the stalker can use this power during any given round. If 1 or more victims lose 4 or more points from this attack, the stalker gains 1d6 additional points of Disposition.
If the stalker loses half her Disposition, she attempts to grab the nearest target and pull them into the lake. They must save against their Strength in order to break free, otherwise they suffer 1d8 damage each round as they drown in the stalker’s arms.

The Underfolk
In the grim darkness of the underworld, the Law is unknown. What passes for civilization here must contend with monstrous beasts and limitless depravity. Only the vicious rage of the underfolk stands between them and death inside the mouths of monsters.

Level 1-4 evil beastlings.
Armour 15, Hit Die 1d6, Morale -1, Numbers 1d4 (2d8), Speed 7, Surprise -1.
Cha 6, Dex 12, Fer 16, Hth 8, Int 8, Wil 12.
Skills: Scavenging and stealth.
1 bite or claw attack per round.
* Half damage from cold, disease, fire, and poison.
* Heightened sense of touch, smell, and hearing (able to navigate in darkness).

The underfolk live in underground regions or old and otherwise-abandoned cities.
They are not comfortable with the open sky above, preferring the protection of their familiar tunnels beneath the sunlit lands. It is these areas where nightmare incursions have the most freedom to grow strong, however. As a result, the underfolk are usually much better informed about the locations of a city’s incursions than its human inhabitants are.
While the underfolk speak their own crude languages, they will occasionally learn to communicate with human vagrants, who learn to trade words with them and cooperate to fend off feral animals, human villains, and even nightmares and other monsters.

Wasp Riders
What crazed wizards conceived of these abominations to defend their already-impregnable tower? What deranged mind could have use for a monster such as this?

Level 3 evil golems.
Armour 13, Hit Die 1d6, Morale +1, Numbers 1d6 (2d10), Speed 7, Surprise 0.
Cha 0, Dex 12, Fer 14, Hth 0, Int 10, Wil 8.
1 arcane whip attack per round, or 1 bite and 1 claw in close combat.
* Double damage from cold and frost-based attacks.
* Half damage from piercing weapons.

When mounted, a wasp rider may attack at any point during its movement. When using the arcane whip, a wasp rider rolls to attack against the target’s Willpower score instead of their Armour.

Giant Wasps
Level 2 neutral beastlings.
Armour 14, Hit Die 1d8, Morale 0, Size Large, Speed 7 (moves 14 flying), Surprise +1.
Cha 4, Dex 10, Fer 12, Hth 12, Int 8, Wil 6.
2 bite attacks per round (must stop moving to make an attack).
* Double damage from fire.

Giant wasps must be created individually, in an alchemical laboratory, from specimens of several normal species.

Wound Men
Soldiers see men butchered all the time, cut down by blades, shot dead by archers and musketeers, scalded to death by boiling oil, their heads split open by clubs and maces. For some men, it becomes too much, haunting their dreams, feeding the nightmares that grow in the darkness from beyond.

Level 3 evil nightmares.
Armour 20, Hit Die 1d4, Morale +5, Numbers 1d4 (2d6+1), Speed 5, Surprise 0.
Cha 0, Dex 8, Fer 14, Hth 0, Int 6, Wil 10.
1 unarmed attack per round.
* Double damage from fire, lightning, and magic.

When you attack a wound man with a mundane weapon, if your total is lower than its Armour score, there is a 50/50 chance that your weapon becomes stuck in the wound man. Stuck weapons cannot be removed until the wound man is destroyed.

Mutilated Wound Men
If a wound man is destroyed but 3 or 4 of its limbs are still attached to its body, it rises again to attack intruders. The head is not necessary. A mutilated wound man has none of the special powers a normal wound man has, but are covered in blood which makes them impossible to grab, pin, or hold on to.

Level 2 evil nightmares.
Armour 10, Hit Die 1d6, Morale +5, Numbers special, Speed 7, Surprise -1.
Cha 0, Dex 12, Fer 14, Hth 0, Int 4, Wil 10.
1 unarmed attack per round (1d6 damage).

Weapon Men
If the weapons that were once stuck in a wound man are not removed from the incursion, after 1d4 turns, they become animated, converging into a malevolent man-shaped figure.

Level 1 evil nightmares.
Armour 14, Hit Die 1d8, Morale +5, Numbers special, Speed 9, Surprise +1.
Cha 0, Dex 14, Fer 14, Hth 0, Int 2, Wil 10.
2 weapon attacks per round.
* Double damage from acid and corrosive materials.
* Half damage from lightning.
* Immune to cold, fi re, and slashing and piercing weapons.

When you take damage from a weapon man, you have a 1 in 6 chance of contracting lockjaw, which incapacitates you for 1d6 months and kills you unless you save against your Health. Medical treatment is relatively easy to obtain in civilized areas.

Rust Never Sleeps
Most weapons that become stuck in a wound man become too rusted and damaged to be properly functional after a mere 1d4 hours. Blades become pitted and dull, wooden hafts become soaked in blood and warped, and other materials deteriorate as well. A weapon man can attack with these weapons, but this power is supernatural (and these weapons also cause lockjaw).
Magical weapons are usually not affected by the powers of the wound men, and do not become stuck. Mundane weapons made of copper, brass, or bronze (such as those used by faeries), may become stuck, but will not rust.

Troupe Style Play
Nightmare incursions don’t wait around passively while PCs are resting up, licking their wounds, and recovering their lost attribute points. They get worse, and time is of the essence. If players don’t want all their characters to wait while a few of them regain their strength, you can create a pool of characters, who can either belong to one specific player each, or are available for anyone to play. When you prepare for a sortie into the dungeon, each player chooses one character each (or two each, if your group is small) from the pool, and that’s your adventuring party.
Meanwhile, unchosen characters remain at home. They continue to recover if they are wounded; or not, if they don’t need to. When a character is chosen to return to adventuring after more than a week, use the downtime rules and decide how much they have spent on living in civilization, as normal.

Elements of a Settlement
When the PCs go to a settlement, you need to determine how large it is and the corresponding settlement die size. This is used when the PCs hire retainers and make trouble (see pages 140 and 152).
Because of their bustling populations, large settlements like cities and even towns should not be placed on the map randomly during play. Their existence and location would be common knowledge -- information that all PCs should have easy access to. Smaller settlements, especially villages and military forts, are the kinds of settlements it is easy for travellers to stumble across.
Once you have decided on the existence of a settlement, you can use the tables on the next page to determine prominent aspects of its culture, problems, and resources. You can also use the professions table on the previous page to determine what kinds of goods and services this settlement is especially known for. However, keep in mind that just because a settlement has problems or a lack of resources doesn’t mean your players will want to get involved in its social life. Always be prepared to let a settlement fall to the incursions of the nightmare realm.
