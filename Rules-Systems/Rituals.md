#### Rite of Naming (Major)
The more powerful the wizard, the harder she is to kill. Powerful wizards slow their aging, cast spells with such skill and ease, they protect themselves with several ongoing spells. Eventually, such wizards are nearly invulnerable, capable of surviving dismemberment, decapitation, and so on. Or so they would have their enemies believe.
All wizards have 1 vulnerability in common: their true name. Simply speaking the name is not enough; 1 must observe all the proper rituals. When properly prepared, the rite of naming effectively strips a wizard of all her spells and powers, making her no more than any other mortal. A true name holds power because it grounds the wizard in the rules of reality. When a wizard begins down the road of sorcery, she distances herself from her roots, as she develops powers allowing her to twist reality to suit her own needs. The name acts as a tether, and as long as she conceals it, her true name cannot affect her.
The Rite of Naming is a complicated process functioning similarly to a spell. The first step to using this ritual is to identify the name. Such a process is often difficult as spellcasters actively work to hide their true identities, meticulously eradicating the information from any record, or killing those who would know. Researching true names is a difficult process, involving luck in finding such information, and then being able to decipher the text as authors hide this information in code and ciphers. To find the true name a character must succeed on an appropriate Research check on a body of information containing the name. If the check succeeds, the individual uncovers the name. Additional deciphering may be required if the name is concealed in code or a foreign language.
Once the name has been uncovered, the researcher must imbue the name with words of power. This act requires 1 day plus 1 day per magnitude of the subject. At the end of this time, the speaker must attempt a special Intelligence check against a base DC 20 modified as follows:

Empowering The True Name
Condition                | Mod
-------------------------|-
Each Lv of spell slot    | +1
Speaker Lv of spell slot | -1

Success and failure have variable results based on the degree of success of the check.

| 01-09 | **Backlash (Severe)**: Participants take 1d20+Target Magnitude damage, and must start fresh, and at -DisAdv for every previous failure.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 10-14 | **Minor Backlash**: speaker takes 1d6+ target magnitude damage, and must start fresh, and at +5 difficulty to Intelligence check per previous failure.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 15-19 | Nothing                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 20-24 | **Fragment**: Empowering a fragment of the name allows the speaker to affect the spellcaster more easily than before. If the spellcaster hears the spoken fragment, the speaker gains advantage to attack rolls against the spellcaster whose name they uttered as a bonus action in the round in which they speak it. Fragments can also be embedded into a weapon. In such instances, the weapon deals 1 point of Constitution damage in addition to the normal damage. Finally, the speaker can incorporate the fragment into a spell. Doing so increases the casting level 1, but the target takes disadvantage to any save allowed, and the attacker gains advantage on spell attacks. |
| 25-29 | **Partial**: Empowering a partial name allows the speaker to affect the spellcaster in more significant ways. If the spellcaster hears the spoken partial name as an action, the speaker gain all the advantages of a fragment but lasts until the next sunrise. Alternatively, a partial name can be used to damage a spellcaster's connection to spells; each hit or utterance uses up a spell slot.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 30+   | **Full**: By uttering the full truename of another spellcaster, the speaker gains complete mastery over the named. If the spellcaster hears the speaker utter their full truename as an action, the spellcaster permanently loses all their spell slots. In order to cast a spell other than cantrips, a spellcaster must have at least 1 spell slot available. Hence, this permanently prevents a spellcaster from casting spells until such time that they gain at least 1 spell slot from another source, via a quest. Furthermore, all magic maintained by the spellcaster ceases as if it were never cast. All ritual connections are lost.                                            |

**Consequences**
Depending on the success of empowering the truename, an individual gains a certain degree of power over the subject. Note, when incorporated into the verbal component of a spell, another character who succeeds DC20 Perception (or Arcana15) check to learn the name, though without some magical skill, they can't do anything with it. In all cases, a spellcaster's magical defenses can't do anything with it. In all cases, a spellcaster's magical defenses cannot affect a weapon imbued with their partial or full truename.

Rite of Taking (Grand)
The highest forms of magic are available only to a select few, exclusively to those willing to pay the high price of magic in its purest form. Most spellcasters never achieve more than the 3rd Magnitude, which is significant in its own right, but a few, namely the Taken and the Shadowmasters can achieve even greater heights of power, in the 4th and highest Magnitude. Called the Rite of Taking, it binds a wizard to another while unlocking the final barriers to magical mastery.
The Rite of Taking itself involves little more than exposing the candidate to the full horrors of their sponsor's arsenal, from summoned demons and physical assaults, to being brought close to death, only to return to more misery. What unifies all processes of Taking are that the subject suffers terribly, as they break free from the bounds of reality to acquire unmatched power. The only restriction is that the Taken are bound to the Taker, for if their master dies or is otherwise stripped of their power, they lose the benefits of this ritual.
The Rite of Taking is actually a series of powerful spells that systematically deconstruct the subject and rebuilds them into something new. Traditionally, taking was the purview of the Dominator, but the Lady proved she too could claim devoted servants, though not as powerful as those created by her husband.
Furthermore, Longshadow clearly had the power of a Taken rivaling the Lady at the height of her power, easily surpassing the Howler and Stormbringer. Thus, Taking is not exclusive to the Dominator, and those with the desire and the power can claim servants of their own. However, they themselves must achieve the Fourth Magnitude, likely through being Taken themselves.
To gain the ability to Take, and thereby promote a spellcaster to a higher magnitude, a spellcaster must have been subject to the ritual themselves and spent the time to develop a Taking ritual of their own.
The Rite of Taking requires at a minimum of 8 hours of uninterrupted spellcasting. During this time, the spellcaster targets the subject with 1 spell effect of every spell she knows, of which the subject may not resist, voluntarily failing all the saving throws. All damage dealt is lethal, though the Taker often pauses to heal some of the damage to keep the candidate alive. At the end of the spellcasting, the spellcaster permanently bestows 1 point of spell energy to the candidate that serves to advance the candidate by 1 magnitude, and gains the Taken template.
To retain some control over the Taken, the Taker extracts oaths of service from the subject. The subject of the Rite may not directly attack the Taker, and they must obey every command to the letter of the command. Taken may indirectly work against their masters, however doing so puts them at risk of losing this added power. In addition, Taken are not required to follow the intent of the command, only the word, so some orders are open to interpretation.
Like all abrogations of free will, the Rite of Taking is taboo among humans, to say nothing of its associations with its use among the Eldar. Dwarves have some knowledge of the Rite, but it remains uncommon due to that people's inherent difficulty with attaining magical power in general.
