Fighter -- Barbarian
Primary: STR for melee attacks, CHA to lead troops & win initiative.
Gear: A wide variety of weapons to exploit different foes' weaknesses and to replace weapons that break. They should also bring armor and shields for protection on the front lines.

Thief -- Ranger
Primary: DEX (pick locks, sneak, climb, assassinate), and WIS (track, range attacks).
Gear: Lockpicks, crowbars, rope, grease, lanterns, grapples, range weapons, ammo.

Cleric -- Witch -- Druid
Primary: CHA to attract followers, spread your beliefs, and commune with entities and WIS to control your miracles and resist magic.
Gear: As many relics as possible in order to build connections with different entities. Druids and Witches may want to save item slots for their familiars.

Bard -- Charlatan
Primary: CHA for disguise and perform and DEX for thievry.
Gear: Musical instruments, cards, juggling balls, flash powder, costumes, etc.

Wizard -- Alchemist
Primary: INT to cast more and higher level spells and to brew higher level potions and WIS to control and resist magic.
Gear: magical codices, monster parts, monster essences, alchemy equipment, cauldrons.

Item Slots

Slot Size: Holds about 5lb/2kilos. Items such as codex, potion, sword, shield, 200 coins, or 2 days rations take up 1 slot. Some larger and bulkier items like 2-handed weapons take up more.

Ready Slots: Items in the PC's hands should be placed in the first 2 slots. Slots 3 and 4 are considered "readied" and can be freely accessed at an time.

Packing Slots: If a character wants to grab an item from a slot 5 or higher during combat, they must roll that item's slot or higher on a d20 to grab it without using an action. If they fail, it takes an action to retrieve. Rearranging items takes a 10minTurn.

Injuries
When a PC receives injuries, they're marked on the highest numbered slots not already marked. Items in those slots may break.

Injury Types: Injuries can be whatever the GM sees fit. For example; hungry, thirsty, burned, pieced, slashed, clubbed, exhausted, overheated, frozen, etc.

Removing Injuries: 1 injury is removed each morning as long as the PC slept for at least 2 Watches and ate a meal the night before. The GM is free to modify this rule. For example: multiple injuries could be removed if they are not very severe, or the use of medicine might be required before a wound is healed. Some injuries may be so severe that they take much longer to heal or cannot be healed at all.

PC Death: If all the PC's slots are filled with injuries, they die.

Damage
Any damage a PC takes is subtracted from their HP. Once HP is gone, each point of damage adds an appropriate injury to an item slot (a slashing weapon inflicts slashes, for example).

Direct Damage: Direct damage imposes injuries directly, bypassing HP. This occurs when a creature's combat experience would not protect them, for example when falling or attacked unawares.

Monster Damage: NPCs and monsters usually do not receive injuries (since they don't have item slots) and simply die at zero HP. Direct damage to a monster deals triple damage to their HP.

Breakage
Items in slots that receive an injury become broken if they're susceptible to that kind of damage. For example, a mace would break a potion, but wouldn't affect a coil of rope.

Hazards

Fire
- Torch: 1 direct damage per Round.
- Campfire: 1d6 direct damage per Round.

- Drowning: Creatures can hold their breath for 30 seconds (3Rounds) for each point of CON. After this point, they pass out and must make a CON check every round or die.
- Cold Water: Characters immersed in cold water must make a CON check every minute. If they fail, they take 1 direct damage.

Survival
- Lightning: 3d6 direct damage.
- Falling: Creatures take 1d6 damage per 10ft fallen, to a max of 20d6.
- Falling Objects: Objects deal damage per 10ft fallen.

- Hunger: Not eating prevents PCs from gaining HP from resting.
- Thirst: After 1 day not drinking, PCs have a -5 penalty on all actions. After 2 days, -10. After 3 days, they must make a CON save or die every hour.
- Sleep Deprivation: Penalty on all checks. For each day you're sleep deprived, you take an additional 1d6 damage from fatigue, which cannot be prevented. If this HP loss would cause an injury, you instead fall asleep.
- Intoxication: Penalty on all checks. Each hour you spend getting intoxicated, make a CON check. On a failure, take 1d6 damage. If this causes an injury, you pass out after marking the injury.

Transport
Creatures take up slots equal to their combat speed. The weight of what they're carrying is usually ignored for simplicity, but can be added in at the GM's discretion.

Crew: drawn vehicles count the animals as crew.
Spd: these speeds assume averages, drawn vehicles use the speed of the animal crew. These speeds assume 2moves, many vehicles can be Force Marched to increase their movement by x10, at the cost of automatic 1d6 damage per move.
1* ocean currents or going downstream can double-to-quintuple your speed, but increases your risk of damage (1in6 per)

Travel

Watches
While on a journey, days are divided into 6 watches: three for the day, 3 for night. Each watch is 4 hours long. Most major actions (travel, forage, etc.) take a watch to complete.

| d6  | Journey Hazards (end of each Watch)                                                                                                                                                       |
| --- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | **Encounter**: Usually rolled from a table designed for the region or terrain type. DM may also randomly determine encounter's reaction to party, current activity, & encounter distance. |
| 2   | **Fatigue**: Each party member takes 1 damage unless they spend the next watch eating a ration & resting. Damage may be higher in difficult weather or terrain. Ignore while camping.     |
| 3   | **Loss**: Each PC rolls d10+10 & loses the item in that item slot (if any) or takes 1 damage. Ignore while camping.                                                                       |
| 4   | **Weather**: The weather changes or some local effect begins.                                                                                                                             |
| 5   | **Sign**: The party finds a sign of the next encounter.                                                                                                                                   |
| 6   | **Free**: No effect.                                                                                                                                                                      |

Travel Speed: 3mph; 1mph in darkness, in difficult terrain, or severe weather. +1mph when using a road. Characters can travel up to 3 watches per day.

Forced March: characters can move x2 speed, but must CON check vs DC5 at end of each Watch or take 1d6 damage.

Navigation: It is up to the party to find their way from location to location, using roads, trails, itineraries, directions, and/or local guides. If the terrain or weather is disorienting, the GM may require a WIS check to see if they get lost.

Getting Lost: If the party is lost, the GM should roll 1d6, the facing of the '1' side determines which direction they veered off; if it points up or down, they made no real progress. Climbing a high point should usually allow the party to get their bearings & spot any landmarks or obvious points of interest.

Hidden Features: the party can spend a watch exploring an area of about 1sq mile (640 acres) to automatically reveal any features that aren't noticed by simply passing through the area (an overgrown ruin, hidden pool, etc.).

Secret Features: secret features (a ruin's secret entrance, the dryad in the pool) should have corresponding clues & can only be found through PC interaction.

Foraging
Takes a watch and requires a WIS check modified by factors like weather, terrain, etc. On a success, the PC collects 1d6 rations-worth. 3 rations fit in 1 item slot.

Terrain Types
Below are examples of how different types of terrain might affect travel. This list should be modified or expanded based on the needs of individual campaigns.
- Open Forest: trees are scattered enough that it doesn't impede movement; bonus to foraging.
- Dense Forest: almost total canopy cover. Half speed, bonus to forage; disorienting.
- Grassland: Flat terrain with minimal obstructing veg; penalty to forage, disorienting.
- Hills: Frequent crests & valleys; half speed.
- Mountains: Steep & treacherous; half speed, +1 fatigue damage, penalty to forage, disorienting.
- Wetlands: Stagnant water & dense veg; half speed, +1 fatigue damage unless travelling by boat, bonus to forage. Disorienting if forested.
- Rough: flat but arduous; half speed, +1 fatigue damage, penalty to forage.
- Water: impassable without boat; bonus to forage.

Sleep & Healing

Healing: Each morning PCs may recover lost HP, as long as they slept for at least 2 watches and ate a meal (1 ration) the night before. In a safe haven they roll a number of d6s = to their level, otherwise they roll half as many. The sum of the dice is the PCs new HP total, if higher than their current HP. This process also removes 1 injury from an item slot, provided the PC has a way of treating that injury.

Night Watches: During the three night watches, the PCs should take turns so that someone is always on watch and everyone gets 2 watches of sleep. If no one is on watch, any encounters rolled will ambush the party.

Weather

Starting Weather: At the start of the game, find the appropriate season table and roll 2d6 for each of three weather elements: Precipitation, Wind, and Temperature.

Changing the Weather: When you roll a Weather result on the Hazard Die, reroll any elements of the current weather that have an asterisk, using the appropriate season table. If none of the elements has an asterisk, randomly pick one element to reroll. If you want the weather to be a bit more chaotic, reroll two or three elements instead.

Designing Your Own Weather: These tables are (very roughly) based on weather in the temperate zone of North America and Europe, so may wish to create your own weather tables that are a better fit for your campaign setting.

Weather Effects
- Light Rain: Everything gets wet. Rations, papers, and so on may be spoilt if not properly protected.
- Heavy Rain: As with light rain, but also reduces visibility, disorients PCs, slows movement, drowns out sound, and creates mud. If rain continues for several days, flooding and landslides may occur. +1 fatigue damage.
- Lightning: May spook horses or ignite things. Generally does not strike PCs (3d6 damage) unless they are really asking for it.
- Hail: Reduces visibility, disorients PCs, slows movement, and drowns out sound. +1 fatigue damage.
- Light Wind: Carries scents and makes long-range attacks difficult. Can reduce visibility if rain, dust, or similar are present.
- Strong Wind: As with light wind, but also makes short-range attacks difficult, slows movement, drowns out sound, and blows things over.
- Fog: Reduces visibility and disorients PCs.
- Freezing: Liquids freeze. Light rain becomes snow, heavy rain becomes heavy snow. Snow reduces visibility (zero visibility in a heavy snow), slows movement, and disorients PCs. Snow remains on the ground as long as it is freezing. For snow to completely melt, it takes the same number of days above freezing as the number of days it snowed. +1 fatigue damage. PCs not wearing warm clothing take d6 direct damage per watch.
- Cold: +1 fatigue damage to PCs not wearing warm clothing.
- Hot: +1 fatigue damage to PCs who don’t have at least three empty slots.
- Humid: +1 fatigue damage to PCs who don’t have at least three empty slots.
- Scorching: +1 fatigue damage. PCs who don’t have at least three empty slots take d6 direct damage per watch.

Delving

Turns
While dungeon delving, time is divided into 10-minute segments called turns. Most major actions (moving, searching, fighting, resting, etc.) take one turn to complete.

At the end of each turn, roll the d6 Dungeon Hazard die.

| d6  | Dungeon Hazards                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| --- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | **Encounter**: The party has an encounter, usually rolled from a table designed this dungeon. The DM may also randomly determine the encounter’s reaction to the party, current activity, and distance from the party. |
| 2   | **Fatigue**: Each PC takes 1 damage unless they spend their next turn resting.                                                                                                                                         |
| 3   | **Burn**: Torches burn out.                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 4   | **Dungeon Shift**: The dungeon changes in some way.                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 5   | **Sign**: The party finds a sign about the next encounter.                                                                                                                                                             |

Mapping
It is up to the players to draw a map of their surroundings as described by the DM. The DM should only correct map errors that are the result of miscommunication.

Dungeon Movement

800ft (quick), 1600 (reckless), 2400 (full tilt) per 10mTurn.

Crawl: The standard movement rate in a dungeon is 80ft (16 five-ft squares) per turn. This allows the party to automatically detect traps, map their environment, and avoid being automatically surprised by encounters.

Walking: 800ft (160 five-ft squares) per turn. At walking speed PCs will be surprised by all encounters and spring all traps.

Running: 2400 feet (480 five-ft squares) per turn. At running speed PCs cannot map their environment, & unprotected lights go out.

Illumination
Light is a vital consideration when dungeon crawling. If the party finds itself in total darkness, most actions will either have major penalties or will be impossible.

Candles: Candles provide enough light to see general shapes within 50ft, and details within 10ft. They burn for 6 hours and use 1/12 of a slot. They go out if dropped or in a light wind.

Lanterns: A candle in a case. Use 1 slot. Can only be blown out by a strong wind, but will go out if dropped.

Torches: Torches provide enough light to see general shapes within 100ft, and details within 20ft. One of them can fit in a slot. They last until the Burn result is rolled on the dungeon hazard die, or until they are submerged or exposed to a strong wind.

Searching

Hidden Features: PCs can spend a turn searching a room-sized area to automatically reveal any non-obvious features (a statuette inside a drawer, a cracked tile, a faint ticking noise, etc.) In dim light like candlelight, this takes two turns.

Secret Features: Secret features (like hidden doors, a letter inside a mattress, etc.) should have corresponding clues and can only be found through PC interaction.

Sleep & Healing
Resting or sleeping in a dungeon never recovers HP or removes injuries, unless the party somehow finds a safe haven there.

Shifts
When the Dungeon Hazard Die indicates a dungeon shift, the dungeon environment changes in some way. Each dungeon will have certain shifts that make more sense for it, but GMs can also use the list below as inspiration. If a dungeon doesn’t have any obvious shifts, use minor effects like sounds, temperature shifts, wind, falling debris, or vermin.

| d8  | Dungeon Shifts                                                                                                                                                                                |

| 2   | **Architecture**: Ceilings, walls, or floors move, sections of the dungeon revolve, slide, or tilt, doors open or close, devices activate, traps rearm, dungeon shakes, rifts open, etc.      |
| 3   | **Flow**: Lava, water, sand, mud, acid, oil, slime, gravel, etc.                                                                                                                              |
| 4   | **Magic**: Petrification, animation, transformation, light, darkness, etc. Use magic random tables for inspiration.                                                                           |
| 5   | **Plants**: Plants start to grow, wither, rot, bloom, block passages, open new routes, etc.                                                                                                   |
| 6   | **Creatures**: Insect swarm, monster activity changes (use activity table), aggression level changes, new faction or monster type appears, encounter frequency changes, alliances shift, etc. |

| 8   | **Dungeon Weather**: Scorching, hot, cold, freezing, humid, rain, fog, light wind, strong wind, static charge, etc.                                                                           |

Encounters

Reactions
When the PCs encounter a creature whose reaction to the party is not obvious, the referee may roll 2d6 on the following table. The creature’s reaction can change quickly based on the party’s actions.

| 2d6 | Reaction                                      | Social Mod |
| --- | --------------------------------------------- | ---------- |

| 4   | **Hostile**: tries to harass or rob the party     | -10        |
| 5   | **Unfriendly**: threatens, insults, or commands   | -5         |
| 6   | **Wary**: Avoids the party                        | -5         |

| 12  | **Admiring**: Tries to join as a follower         | +10        |

Distance & Surprise
You may use the following guidelines to determine how far away the encounter is from the party when this is unclear.
- **Dungeons & Cities**: 2d6 x10ft
- **Wilderness**: 4d6 x30ft

If the encounter occurs within 80ft of the party, the 2 closest creatures from each side should make a WIS vs WIS check. If 1 side wins by 10 or more, they have surprised the other side.

Activity
What the encounter is currently doing will depend a lot on the creature type, environment, etc. Use the table below as inspiration.

| d20 | 1           | 2          | 3            | 4           |

Signs
When the Hazard Die indicates that the party has found a sign, 1st roll a creature from an appropriate random encounter list and then roll or pick what sign of that creature they find.

| d6  | Encounter Sign Type                                                                                                                                                            |

Experience
The GM can assign XP rewards for whatever activity or activities they wish. Some options are listed below.

Treasure Hunting
1 XP is rewarded to the party for every coin recovered from dungeons and returned to civilization, split evenly between all PCs. The monetary value of objects also counts. This option is the "default" means of gaining XP and puts the focus of the game on exploration since valuables are usually hidden or guarded. It also emphasizes resource management, because the more treasure the PCs carry, the fewer slots they have for weapons, armor, etc.

**Coin Type**: Depending on the size of treasure hoards available and the rate of advancement desired, GMs may decide to give 1 XP for each silver coin.

**Spending Treasure**: Some GMs may require players to spend the coins before gaining any XP, or may grant an XP bonus when it is spent on particular things, such as carousing, training, alms, constructing buildings, etc.

Monster Slaying
Neutralizing a monster (usually by killing it, but not necessarily) grants 10 XP per monster level.

Exploration
Exploring a significant location for the first time grants XP to the whole party, split evenly between them. The experience total can be modified by the location's danger and remoteness.
- local significance: 10xp
- regional significance: 100xp
- national significance: 500xp
- global significance: 1000xp

Danger Level
- dangerous for low-level characters: x2
- dangerous for mid-level characters: x10
- dangerous for high-level characters: x50

Remoteness
- 2 days from a safe haven: x2
- 3 days from a safe haven: x3
- etc.

Levels
At certain XP thresholds, PCs gain a level, which increases the number of dice they roll to recover HP as well as improving 3 of their ability scores by 1.
PCs cannot gain more than 1 level per week. Any XP that would advance them to a second level within that week is lost.

| Lv  | Title    | XP Total |
| --- | -------- | -------- |
| 1   | Wretch   | 0        |
| 2   | Lowlife  | 2000     |
| 3   | Hoodlum  | 4000     |
| 4   | Fool     | 8000     |
| 5   | Dastard  | 16000    |
| 6   | Cad      | 32000    |
| 7   | Gadabout | 64000    |
| 8   | Rogue    | 125,000  |
| 9   | Jack     | 250,000  |
| 10  | Knave    | 500,000  |

**Choosing Ability Score Improvements**: The 1st of the 3 ability scores to be improved is chosen randomly, roll d6. The other 2 are chosen by the player. No ability score can be increased more than 1.

Magic is an ancient and exacting art, the laws of which are now lost. It is only manifested today through the use of codices, objects that have been engineered to channel ambient fields of arcane energy into precisely defined and programmed forms.
Codices can look like books, clay tablets, metal spheres, crystals, medallions, or any solid object with enough surface area to inscribe the proper sigils and enough mass to withstand the forces coursing through it. They cannot be copied or created. To acquire a codex one must either excavate it from a ruin or steal it from whoever got there first.
A standard codex takes up one slot and contains a single spell with a level from 1 to 10 indicating its complexity and power. Each spell can be cast only once per day.

Casting Spells
Casting a spell takes one action. PCs cannot cast spells with a level higher than their INT, but many spells have a level that adjusts to the PC’s current INT.
**Spell Checks**: Some spells require a check to see if their target suffers its effect. These checks are use the caster’s WIS vs. the defender’s DEX, CON, or WIS, whichever makes the most sense.

Variants
**Magical Mishaps**: Each spell can be cast an unlimited number of times per day, but PC must make an INT vs. Spell Level check each time they cast a spell. On a failure, the caster cannot cast any more spells that day and they suffer a related magical mishap of the GM’s choice.
**Spellburn**: Each spell can be cast an unlimited number of times per day, but deal damage to the caster equal to their level each time they are cast after the first time.

Spell Name Generation

1. (Effect)+(Element)
2. (Effect)+(Form)
3. (Element)+(Form)
4. (Form) of (Element)
5. (Form) of (Effect) (Element)
6. (Effect) (Element) (Form)

Alchemy

Monster Parts
Harvesting a monster’s body part requires 10 minutes, butchery tools, and an INT vs. Monster Level check to avoid spoiling it. The most useful organs are the ones that produce the monster’s special abilities. For example: A dragon’s lung (fire breathing), a dragon’s eye (unsleeping), a dragon’s scales (fireproof). Each monster part has a level equal to the monster’s level.
Each part takes up at least one slot, due to the packaging and fluids it must be preserved in. Large parts may fill more slots.

Brewing Potions
Brewing a potion requires a fire, a cauldron, ingredients, and 1 hour of time.
1. The player describes the effect and duration of the potion they are trying to make, along with the monster part or parts they wish to use. The parts must be related to the desired effect.
2. If the GM approves the effect and monster parts the PC can make the potion.
3. The PC makes an INT check vs. the combined level of all of the monster parts being used. On a success, the potion is created and the parts are lost. On a failure, the potion is useless.
4. If the PC succeeds at the check by 5 or more, they have created a recipe for that potion, and no longer need to make a brewing check to make that potion when using those exact ingredients.

Potion Effects
Potions generally allow the drinker to produce a single significant magical effect. If the effect is ongoing (like invisibility) it usually lasts for 10 minutes. Weak ongoing effects may last for an hour or even a day if it is very weak.

Potion Miscibility
If 2 potions are mixed together, or a potion is drunk while the effects of another are ongoing, roll on the following table:

| d100  | Effect                                                                                                            |
| ----- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

| 07-10 | **Transmutation**: The mixed potions transform into a random (Element).                                           |
| 11-15 | **Wild Magic**: A new potion results with a random (Effect).                                                      |
| 16-20 | **Immiscible**: The effects of both potions are cancelled.                                                        |
| 21-25 | **Immiscible**: The effect of 1 potion is cancelled.                                                              |
| 26-35 | **Immiscible**: The effects of both potions are halved.                                                           |
| 36-90 | **Miscible**: The effects of both potions are halved.                                                             |
| 91-99 | **Miscible**: The effects of both potions are doubled.                                                            |
| 00    | **Discovery!**: The effect of 1 potion is now permanent, the other is cancelled.                                  |
