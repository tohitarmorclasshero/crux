COMPLICATIONS

  
Complications can be compelled by the GM. You can spend XP to ignore one temporarily for a scene, but getting rid of them permanently requires a great amount of work. If you choose to accept a compel from the GM though, you gain 1 XP, each time.  
  

Here are some examples...  
  

Absent Minded: You forget things laying around.  
Amnesia: You don't remember anything about your identity or your past.  
Amputee: You're missing an arm or a leg.  
Blue Blood: You're one of the elite, the rarefied few. Other powerful people who witness your slumming will either dismiss you out of hand or take an unhealthy interest in you and yours.  
Branded: It's common knowledge that you are or were a bad sort.  
Chip on Shoulder: You can be provoked to violence so easily.  
Credo: You have an inflexible set of principles and will not deviate from them. Just a sentence or two will do.  
Cold As The Black: You feel no deep connection to other people, and prefer to save yourself the trouble.  
Compulsive Buyer: You have to spend money whenever its possible.  
Coward: You're paralyzed with fear whenever you're in combat.  
Crude: You've got some colorful disgusting language and manners.  
Dark Secret: You have a humiliating dark secret; if it were to get out, it would ruin your career.

Second Class: Everyone looks down on you and tries to take advantage of you, assuming you're stupid.
