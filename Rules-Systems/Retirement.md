# Retirement
Retirement
Retirement is just retirement from adventuring. It can be literally anything they way, as long as it's not adventuring and they do not continue on as a player character. They become a friendly NPC instead. If they retire with enough loot, they can become a friendly and powerful NPC. You can retire at any time, not just when Trauma forces them.
Inform the players about everything in the last paragraph. This rule needs to be mostly transparent.

1. When a player retires, ask them what sort of retirement they intend, and how much wealth they are retiring with.
2. Multiply the wealth by the character's level, and look up the result on the table below. Adjudicate the details of the new NPC using your vast prowess, using the numbers below as a guide.

Level x Wealth = Retirement Points (RP)

Less than 100 RP
Probably going to die in a nearby gutter.

100 RP
A chance at a normal life. Apartment, job, loans, loyal dog, relationship problems, taxes. Just a citizen.

1000 RP
Comfortable retirement in position where they can give modest assistance. A bartender who gives you free drinks and rumors. A rancher who gives away horses and rations.

10,000 RP
Excellent retirement in position where they can give major assistance. A tavern keeper who can give you secure lodging and introductions all over the city. A master assassin who will do a couple of jobs for free. The captain of the guard who lies under oath in order to get your case dismissed.

100,000 RP
Go wild, bro.
