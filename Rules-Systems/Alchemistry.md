Monster Parts
Harvesting a monster’s body part requires 10 minutes, butchery tools, and an INT vs. Monster Level check to avoid spoiling it. The most useful organs are the ones that produce the monster’s special abilities. For example: A dragon’s lung (fire breathing), a dragon’s eye (unsleeping), a dragon’s scales (fireproof). Each monster part has a level equal to the monster’s level.
Each part takes up at least one slot, due to the packaging and fluids it must be preserved in. Large parts may fill more slots.

Brewing Potions
Brewing a potion requires a heat, a cauldron, ingredients, and 1hour of per ingredient.
1. The player describes the effect and duration of the potion they are trying to make, along with the monster part or parts they wish to use. The parts must be related to the desired effect.
2. If the GM approves the effect and monster parts the PC can make the potion.
3. The PC makes 1 INT check for every two ingredients combined. On a success, the ingredients are combined and the parts are lost. If using more than 2 ingredients, continue making rolls until all are used. On a failure, the potion is useless.
4. If the PC succeeds at the check by 5 or more, they have created a recipe for that potion, and no longer need to make a brewing check to make that potion when using those exact ingredients.

Chemists tools
Chemistry is the skill of exploiting unique properties of certain plants, minerals, and creature parts, combining them to produce fantastic substances. This set of equipment includes mixing and measuring containers and a miscellany of chemicals necessary for chemical crafting. Proficiency with these tools allows you to extract the chemical elements from various ingredients, and allows you to add your proficiency to any checks you make to craft items with them.

Foraging Ingredients
Make a Nature check, adding your proficiency in chemistry tools to the check if you are not proficient in the Nature skill, with a DC based on your method of searching as per the table below. Each foraging attempt takes 2 hours with the availability of ingredients in the area determined by the DM.

DC \ Search Method
10 \ Dedicated search without traveling
15 \ Traveling at slow or stealthy pace
20 \ Traveling at normal pace

On a failure, you find nothing. On a success, you recover 1 ingredient, first rolling on the Common Ingredients table for the region you are in. If you roll an 11 or 12, reroll on the Special Ingredients table.
Additionally, ingredients can be harvested from dead or incapacitated creatures at the DM's discretion. Harvesting requires 1d6 minutes followed by a DC20 Nature check to harvest a usable ingredient. Should you fail this check, you are unable to extract any usable ingredients.

Crafting from Chemical Recipes
There are 3 primary essences that can be extracted from potent herbs, fungus, or animal parts for use as chemical components: earth(◊), water(≈), fire(ϟ). 
Additionally, some rare ingredients have properties that can be used to further manipulate the 3 elements in the form of 2 types of charge, positive and negative.
The Chemical Recipes section lists several formulas denoting the type and quantity of each chemical element needed to craft an object. Any combination of raw ingredients can be used to complete the recipe, as long as the correct combination of elements is met.
Chemistry requires 4 hours of uninterrupted work per 25gp value of the item being crafted. At the end of each 4-hour period, a Chemistry check DC8 plus 2 for every raw ingredient used. As such, higher-quality ingredients containing more elements will result in a lower DC. On a successful Chemistry check, 25gp of progress is made toward creating the item. On a failure, no progress is made and all used ingredients are lost.
Any item with a total value of 25gp or less may be crafted in the field. Otherwise, crafting must be done in a safe workshop environment.

Custom Chemical Creations
Each of the chemical elements has useful properties on their own that can be combined to create unique substances. The General Chemical Effects table lists these properties which may be combined into a single cup of volatile liquid, to be unleashed by throwing it up to 20ft and releasing it in a 5ft area. Each additional combination adds 15gp of value per effect selected below. Crafting follows the same steps listed in the Crafting from Chemical Recipes section.

General Chemical Effects
Elements \ Effects
2◊ \ Throws shrapnel dealing d4 force damage within 10ft of impact
2≈ \ Releases slippery oil, difficult terrain in a 5ft square
2ϟ+ \ Deals d6 fire damage on contact
◊≈ \ Releases gel that sticks to target, effects repeat each round until gel removed (DC10 Dex check)
2ϟ- \ Deals d6 cold damage on contact
≈ϟ- \ Fills 10ft cube with mist d4 rounds; effects repeat each round for creatures remaining in the mist until it dissipates
ϟ◊ \ Deals d6 acid damage on contact

Chemical Recipes

Acid (25gp) ◊ϟ+ As an action, you can splash this onto a creature within 5ft of you or throw it up to 20ft. In either case, make a ranged attack against a creature or object, treating the acid as an improvised weapon. On a hit, the target takes 2d6 acid damage.

Alchemists Fire (50gp) 2ϟ◊≈ Actually a double-chambered bottle of normally inert substances. When combined, they ignite when exposed to air. As an action, you can throw up to 20ft. Make a ranged attack against a creature or object, treating the alchemists fire as an improvised weapon. On a hit, the target takes d6 fire damage at the start of each of its turns. A creature can end this damage by using its action to make a DC10 Dex check to extinguish the flames or by removing the garment that is on fire.

Breath Bottle (20gp) ◊ϟ- This oversized bottle contains a spongy substance in which a quantity of fresh breathable air can be synthesized. Usable underwater (if the depth is less than 100ft) or in any other environment that lacks breathable air, a character can open this bottle and suck air out, enabling them to breathe directly and continuously from the bottle for up to 10 minutes at normal atmospheric pressure. The time can be conserved by reapplying the stopper.

Dust of Dryness (120gp) 3◊- This small packet contains 6 pinches of dust. You can use an action to sprinkle a pinch of it over water, shrinking a cube of water 15ft on a side into 1 marble-sized pellet, which floats or rests nearby. The pellets weight approximately 1 ounce each. You can smash the pellet as an action to release the water again. Creatures composed mostly of water that are exposed to a pinch of dust must make a DC13 Con save, taking 4d6 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half damage on a success.

Firesnuff (10gp) ϟ- This ashen powder automatically puts out small fires (like campfires or torches) when cast into the flames. It also puts out alchemists fire with 1 application. A character who is on fire can have his flames immediately extinguished with a single dose. Firesnuff deals d8 damage per 5 doses to creatures of fire with a successful ranged improvised weapon attack.

Flash pellet (25gp) 2ϟ+ This tiny pellet is often disguised as a button or other tiny decoration. You can throw a flash pellet up to 15ft. When smashed, it bursts with a bright flash. All creatures within 10ft must make a DC15 Con check or be blinded for 1 round.

Instant Rope (75gp) 2◊2≈- A large skin filled with a pudding-like substance that hardens into a low quality rope 1 minute after being exposed to air, and then disintegrates into a fine powder 2 hours later. Instant rope has 8hp per strand and can be burst with a DC20 Strength check. Each pouch holds enough to make 300ft of cordage.

Melting Powder (50gp) 2ϟ◊ Melts up to 1 cubic ft of ice, or 1 cubic ft of metal when ignited. Causes 2d6 acid damage if ingested, with DC13 Con save for half damage.

Smokestick (20gp) 2◊2ϟ- An incense stick instantly creates a thick, opaque smoke when ignited. The smoke fills a 20ft cube (as fog cloud spell). The stick is consumed after 10 minutes and the smoke dissipates naturally. The smoke is extremely foul smelling, causing nausea in all creatures in range unless a DC15 Con save.

Snappowder (25gp) 2◊+ Makes 5 doses. A colorless powder covers a 5ft area. Any creature weighing more than 20lbs that moves across it sets off tiny harmless explosions with a snapping sound and a tiny flash of light. This effect lets you hear creatures sneaking up on you and see where a creature is moving even if it’s invisible or concealed by normal darkness. You can automatically locate the location of a creature setting off snappowder. The strewn powder can be detected with a DC20 Perception check (-10DC Investigate); it can be swept up without setting it off.

Titan Gum (25gp) 2◊2≈ This ceramic tube can be broken off at the top to pour a strong and fast-setting glue, bonding completely in 1 minute. Bonded objects require a DC20 Strength check to separate and can support up to 500lbs.
