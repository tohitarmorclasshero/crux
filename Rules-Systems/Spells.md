## Spells

### Spells As Items
Access to spells depends on the level of the character, but their number is not limited. However, the prep of a spell is not simply memorizing it -- it must be "made" in the form of a scroll, potion, powder, or even a wand or enchanted item. Cost of the components & time needed to prep a spell is shown in the table below. In case of particularly powerful and/or rare spells Referee may decide to impose additional requirements, such as a special place where the ritual must be celebrated, special equipment or very rare (and do not necessarily expensive) components.

Spell Level | Time Needed | Cost
-- | -- | --
1-2 | 1 day | 200gp per level
3-5 | 14 days per level | 400gp per level
6+ | 1 season per level | 800gp per level
