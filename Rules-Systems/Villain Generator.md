###### Eye of Dread
The unnatural union of a thief's hand, a snake's body, and the eye of either a blind child or a lunatic--is a kind of evil homunculus created by witches of the northern wastes, who employ them to spy on their foes and, occasionally, to suffocate them in their sleep.  
The eye set into the withered palm acts as both a scrying device and a weapon. If the creature was made using a blind eye, then anyone gazing into the eye must save or be blinded for 1-4 rounds. If the creature was made using a maniac's eye then the victim must save or roll on the Insanities That Are Actually Interesting In Combat Table (the effect will last 1-4 rounds). 

Insanities That Are Actually Interesting In Combat Table  
01 | Target becomes a kleptomaniac  
02 | Target PC does exactly the opposite of whatever player wants him/her to do  
03 | Target needs a strong drink before taking any action  
04 | Target attacks nearest friendly PC  
05 | Target believes s/he is nearest friendly PC  
06 | Target is paralysed with indecision  
07 | Target is confused  
08 | Target thinks s/he is dead  
09 | Target thinks s/he is nearest foe  
10 | Target becomes obsessed with nearby irrelevant object  
11 | Target moves toward highest point within his/her ordinary move range and jumps off  
12 | Target drops his/her weapon and begins to cry for help in any and all languages known to him/her  
  
Though possessing a rudimentary intelligence, an Eye of Dread, unlike the #handsnake, is little more than a tool of its mistress, and cannot breed.  
If slain, the creature turns into a glove. The glove will fit no-one except the witch who sent the Eye, and will fit her in whatever guise she may adopt.  

Crunch:  
The Eyes have 1-3 hit dice, and what armor class they have will be due to their small size and relative nimbleness. They grip, poke and choke with an 18 strength.  
  
Design note:  
In movies, you get attacked by werewolves and the next morning you go "Hey, Weird Local--what the hell is going on in this village?" In D&D you get attacked by a werewolf and in the next morning you're just glad it wasn't a weretroll. The Eye may just be weird enough that the PCs might actually investigate it after it tries to kill them.  
Also, since, other than the gaze, the Eyes themselves are pretty weak and rely on strangling and grabbing and surprise, I find they, during combat, bring the environment into play a lot more than a basilisk or something--which can just bite you or claw you if its evil eye doesn't work.  

In play:  
A few of these, well hidden, turned out to be a serious bargain on the mayhem-per-hit-point exchange. One PC went blind and one thought he was an Eye of Dread. So he sat there and looked evilly at his friends. Meanwhile the eyes were busy choking everyone. Then someone cast darkness. The eyes couldn't see anybody but everyone could feel the Eyes crawling on their faces so the PCs started pounding on themselves in the dark. The eyes who escaped crawled into the light and started attacking the blind guy...

A Handsnake appears to be a large, heavy -bodied serpent, with a scaled human hand in place of a head.
The origin of these strange creatures is unknown, but presumed by interested parties to be magical.
Handsnakes are highly individual in temperament. They may be rude, humorous, cruel, lascivious, helpful, etc. An encounter with a handsnake may be either a boon, or a bane to a party, depending on how they handle the meeting.
A handsnake is intelligent, but having no mouth, cannot speak. Instead, they communicate with universally understood hand gestures, or, they may be taught to employ an actual sign language.
A handsnake may attack by coiling and striking as an adder would, but instead of biting with fangs, it will punch with it's fist, or attempt to blind by poking an attacker in the eyes.
A handsnake is capable of wielding a dagger, or hurling rocks, and it's strength in doing so is equal to an adult halfling.
Handsnakes are quirky in their motivations. They have been known to stealthily slither into campsites unnoticed and make off with odd items. Some have proven very friendly and given to offering unnerving handshakes to passers bye. One tale tells of a handsnake murdering a sleeping woman by coiling about her throat and griping its own body with it's hand until she was asphyxiated. Another story relates the actions of a handsnake known as the Insulting Serpent, which apparently made a habit of proffering rude gestures to travelers on the Hocknell road.
The Gold Miner, is the name given to a handsnake which seems to live near the gnome warrens of Gluraumgh. It is much despised for it's game of sneaking up on the unsuspecting and suddenly thrusting one of it fingers deep in the nose of it's victim.
A young handsnake, known as a fingerling, can be raised to be a henchman, or summoned to serve as a familiar. If well treated, they can be invaluable helping hands.
A handsnake does not eat as would a normal snake. It appears that they live by drawing off minute amounts of energy from both living things, and magic items.
Large animals, such as horses and cattle, are sought out by handsnakes as steady sources of sustenance. Despite their unnatural form, the presence of a handsnake is often accepted by these farm and draft animals as it will bring them apples or other treats, and thus win their favor.
A normal, healthy creature of a size larger than a rat will suffer no harm by the feeding of a handsnake, no more than it would by a normal snake seeking the heat of it's body. However, there could possibly be some danger to those gravely wounded, or very small creatures such as pixies or sprites.
Like wise, magic items which carry a permanent enchantment will not be harmed by a handsnakes energy basking. There is some small chance, (5%), that magic items which expend charges, such as wands, may be spontaneously drained by a handsnake.
There are stories, certainly spurious, which tell of monstrously huge handsnakes dwelling far to the south, in the reeking jungles of the equatorial region. These stories are of course, not true, however, if they were true, such a handsnake would be 30 to 60 feet in length, with a hand the size of a giants, and 6 hit dice. Luckily, there is no such thing as a Handaconda.

###### The Fishwife
Fishwives typically appear clad in long white dresses of moist lace and inhabit rotting, rudderless vessels or lonely towers perched atop islands far out at sea. They use magic to ensnare passing ships, order their subordinates to shanghai the luckless crews, and seek to marry the comeliest males among them in short, bizarre ceremonies presided over by docile, stoop-shouldered, fish-headed clerics in tweed vests.
In appearance, the fishwives are entirely horrific, with their fishy heads and fish-scaled skin contrasting more decisively and more grotesquely with their human anatomy than in the case of the (perhaps unrelated) kuo-toa.
Despite their fondness for human finery, the fishwives are aware of the loathesomeness of their condition, and deplore it. It has been theorized that they hope, through unions with attractive human males, to gradually breed the hideousness out of their bloodline. The efficacy of this strategy is as yet untested, as every man awakening groggily from this or that unsuccessful attempting to repel a seaborne raid to find himself dressed in formalwear in a crude chapel on the arm of a fishwife has either divorced her immediately or died trying.
The magics employed by the fishwife are akin to those employed by the sea hag, typically imparting influence over weaker creatures, foul weather, the body, and the brine.

###### Maggot Naga
Maggot (or Grub) Nagas are uncanny beasts with the heads of beautiful women and bloated, white, wormlike bodies. They range from three to six feet in length, and are as likely to be found conversing in the meeting halls of great houses as nesting in the digestive tracts of aging dragons. Whether these unsettling creatures are related to true nagas is unclear, but they exhibit similar abilities--albeit on a lesser scale--and an even more frightening intelligence. They are prized in certain rarefied circles for their unusual insight into the science of governance.

Crunch & In-Play Notes:
Statwise, the Maggot Naga is basically a low-powered version of a water naga--a spellcasting monster with a poison bite; though you might consider giving it a couple gimmicks of its own, like it can automatically turn arrows fired at it into overlong maggots or its bite causes a [random mutation]
The real point of the Maggot Naga is to wander around the campaign being both elegant and disgusting. I would role-play it completely straight--as if it's a perfectly sensible young Machiavellian advisor or lady-in-waiting who roams the castle (or chews its way through a frost giant's intestines), talking about grain production rates or discussing who is going to take the ring to Mount Doom that just happens to have the body of a great glistening maggot.
When the local Count invites the PCs for a sit-down about the recent peasant rebellion over dinner and there's a maggot-woman in the next chair articulately arguing the fine points of drought prevention in between face-first gulps of mutton, your players are bound to start wondering whether this regime--or any regime--could possibly be as corrupt as this looks, or whether this is just some sort of don't-judge-a-book-by-its-cover lesson in diplomacy and the grub chick is really just a perfectly nice young lady who has learned to be tirelessly patient in the face of persistent prejudice from superstitious rubes.
Which of these is the truth is, of course, entirely in the hands of the DM.

**Acid Excretion**
The mutant sweats an extremely potent acid. The mutant can not wear armor and normal melee weapons are destroyed when they successfully hit the mutant. Successful unarmed melee attacks cause 1d5 damage to the attacker. Adjust Fellowship by -10 permanently.

**Additional eye**
The mutant grows an extra eye. This change is otherwise cosmetic though helmets will have to be specially made, adjust Fellowship by -10 permanently.

**Agility**
The mutant becomes extremely agile; adjust Agility by +10 permanently.

**Albino**
The mutant is weakened and enervated. Its skin becomes a dead white skin and it develops glowing red eyes. Adjust Toughness and Fellowship by -10 permanently.

**Alcoholism**

**Atrophy**
One or more parts of the mutant's body become shriveled and atrophied. As a result the mutant loses the use of part of its body. Roll d10 to determine how many body parts atrophy:
01-05 | One
06-08 | Two
09-10 | Three
Roll d10 to see which parts atrophied:
01-02 | Head, reduce Intelligence by half permanently
02-05 | Arm, lose the use of that arm
06-10 | Leg, lose the use of that leg.

**Beaked**
The mutant has a beak such as a bird, octopuses, or platypus although its other facial features remain unchanged. The mutants bite now does d6+SB+1Pen. Adjust Fellowship by -10 permanently

**Bestial Face**
The mutant's face becomes identical to that of some sort of beast. Adjust Cha-10 permanently and roll d10 on the table to see what their face looks like:

03-09 | Goat with horns
10 | Reroll with d20+10
11 | Waxy & flattened, like a potato sack with gashes
12-15 | Cosmetic only (ape, bear, deer, horse)
16-22 | Gain bite d10+SB (ant, boar, bull, dog, lion, weasel)
23-24 | Gain bite d10+SB & Dark Sight (bat, tiger)

27-28 | Gain bite d6+SB+1Pen & Perception(sight)+10 (eagle, raven)
29 | Rabbit, Perception(hear)+10
30 | Dragon; bite d10+SB and as a Bonus action can Breath Fire as a Hand Flamer

**Beweaponed Extremities**
All of the mutant's hands or paws are turned into ornate weapons marked with the rune of the mutant's patron Chaos Power. Adjust Cha-10 permanently and roll d10 on the following table. The mutant now has no normal hands. All weapons have +1Pen more than normal.
01-05 | Blade
06-10 | Club

**Big Ears**
The mutant has enormous ears and gets +10 to Perception in Hearing related tests

**Bird's Feet**
The mutant's legs and feet become birdlike, adjust Fellowship by -10 permanently. This change is otherwise cosmetic though special shoes would be required.

**Grey Skin**
The mutant's skin becomes completely grey. Its eyes, however, turn completely vantablack. The mutant's sight is unaffected by this alarming change. The mutant's physical make-up is otherwise unchanged only its color is altered. The mutant gets Stealth+10 and adjust Cha-10 permanently.

**Blood Rage**
The mutant becomes frenzied when within 10 meters of a wounded creature it can see, including itself. The mutant must pass an Ordinary (+10) Willpower test or Frenzy.

**Blood Substitution**
The nature of the mutant's blood changes radically. This causes Fear 1 when revealed. Roll d6 and consult the chart to see what the blood substitute is.
01-03 | Leeches or Maggots: Adjust CON+2 permanently. Whenever the mutant is wounded, a stream of squirming things pours out of the wound attaching themselves to the attacker.

The Profile of the newly hybrid mutant is an average of the 'old' mutant and the randomly determined creature. Pairs of characteristics are added together and divided by two. The results are then rounded down to the nearest whole number.

Its physical form also changes to a mixture of its 'parent' creatures. Roll d10 and consult the table below for the mutant's head, upper body, lower body, each pair of arms, and each pair of legs individually. The table below indicates which of its two 'parents' the hybrid mutant resembles in that body part.
1 – 3   Mutant Parent
The mutant's current form is dominant in this body area but it gains some of the features associated with the creature parent; eg a mutant-eagle crossbreed retains a human head, although this is beaked, or a mutant-Ork crossbreed retains its general form but its skin becomes green.

4 – 7   Compromise
The mutant develops an appearance that is a mixture of its two parents; eg a mutant-spider crossbreed gains a set of mandibles on a furry head but retains a 'normal' pair of eyes and a nose.

9 – 10 Creature Parent
The hybrid develops the appearance of its creature 'parent' in this area; eg when crossbreeding with a warhorse the mutant's legs become equine and hairy.

As far as possible without creating rules contradictions the mutant is subject to any special rules that applied to its 'parent' creatures.

Each creature has its own profile. From now on determine new Chaos attributes separately for each 'half' of the mutant. While each twin has its own wound total, if either of them is killed, both die. If a second Twin result is rolled they become triplets and so on.

**Telekinesis**
The mutant has the ability to manipulate inanimate objects with the power of its mind alone. The mutant gains the use of the Telekinesis power without having to roll a psychic test.

**Teleport**
The mutant can teleport itself and possibly others from one location to another. On a 1 or a 2 the mutant can teleport others in addition to itself, otherwise it can only teleport itself. If the mutant is capable and wants to take someone along they must be within 2 meters. A Routine (+10) Willpower test is needed if the target wants to resist the teleport. The mutant can not teleport into a solid object, into the air, or someplace it can not see and it takes a full round action to attempt a teleport. Every teleport roll 2d10 add them together and multiply it times 10, this is the percentage of the desired distance the mutant teleported. A result over 100 is unused excess but a 200 is a critical failure and the teleported person goes 200+m in a random direction.

**Temporal Instability**
The mutant's position in time grows unstable and it may, at times, 'slip sideways' in time to another, parallel time stream. Roll 1d10 to determine how much control the mutant has over this ability.
d10   | Temporal Nature
------|----------------
01-08 | **Involuntary**: In times of stress, such as combat, the mutant may slip 1d5 rounds into the future. A Difficult (-10) Willpower test is needed to resist.
09-10 | **Voluntary**: The mutant can initiate the slip to 1d5 rounds into the future with a Ordinary (+10) Willpower test, plus or minus one round as they see fit.

**Tentacles**
The mutant's arms wither and turn into grasping tentacles covered in fine suckers. Tentacles can grip weapons but limit fine manipulation. If the mutant only has tentacles all fine manipulations are at an additional -20. Adjust Fellowship by -10 permanently Roll 1d5 to determine how many arms are affected.
d6    | Arms Affected
------|--------------
01-03 | One arm is affected.
04-05 | d4-2 arms are affected
05    | All arms are affected

**Transparent skin**
The mutant's skin becomes completely transparent, revealing its inner structure - bones, organs, muscles, sinews, digestive system, for all to see.  This is extremely bizarre. The mutant gains Fear 1, adjust Fellowship by -20 permanently

**Uncanny Resemblance**
The mutant's facial features and, to whatever extent is practical, the rest of its physical characteristics resemble a member of your gaming group, some other associate or relative. This is completely cosmetic.

**Uncontrollable Flatulence**
One of the mutant's bodily orifices emits clouds of gas, Adjust Fellowship by -20 permanently. Roll 1d10 to check type of gas.
d10   | Gas Description
------|--------------
01-02 | Poison smoke doing 1d10 Toxic damage.
03-04 | Paralyzing anyone in the cloud must pass an Ordinary (+10) Toughness test or be unable to move.
05-06 | Noxious anyone in the cloud must pass an Ordinary (+10) Toughness test or spend the round retching and vomiting.
07-08 | Oily Smoke, -10 to tests shooting through it.
09-10 | Crazy as a Hallucinogen grenade.

**Vampire**
The mutant's metabolism changes so that it can no longer survive without a regular intake of warm, fresh blood. The mutant's appearance gradually becomes pale and cadaverous and its temperature drops to a sepulchral chill and it gains the Vampiric trait.

**Vividly Colored Skin**
The mutant's skin or pelt turns an exceptionally vivid color. This is often a color associated with the mutant's Chaos Power (brazen red for Khorn, pastel and electric shades for Slaanesh, swamp-green for Nurgle, and an ever-changing iridescence for Tzeentch) but need not be so. Bright purples, pinks, oranges, and electric greens and blues are all possible.
This causes a -10 to hide checks and adjust Fellowship by -10 permanently

**Walking Head**
The mutant's body atrophies and withers to nothing, while its head expands to several times its original size. The mutant’s limbs also shift position, becoming attached directly to the head and the vestigial neck. Armor must be specially made, all hits to the body count as hits to the head and adjust Fellowship by -20 permanently

**Warp Frenzy**
The mutant become subject to Frenzy of a particularly virulent type, when it becomes frenzied it gains 1d10+1 Chaos attributes during the duration of the frenzy. These may be rolled every time or saved from time to time

**Warty Skin**
Every inch of the mutant's body is covered in repulsive warts. Adjust Toughness by +10 and Fellowship by -10 permanently

**Weapon Master**
The mutant gains an innate understanding of how to use weapons to the best effect in the service of Chaos. Add +10 to either Weapon or Ballistic skill.

**Wings**
The mutant grows a pair of wings. Adjust Fellowship by -10 permanently and roll d10 to determine size of wings.
d10   | Wings Description
------|----------------
01-04 | Small wings - Can not fly
05-07 | Medium - the mutant gets the trait Flight 1
08-10 | Large the mutant gets the trait Flight 2

**Zoological**
One or more parts of the mutant's body change into the corresponding parts of some animal. Adjust Fellowship by -20 permanently and Roll 1d100 to determine how many parts of the mutant's body undergo this startling change. In some cases the resulting mutations will duplicate the effects of another entry on this table such as Bird Feet or Scorpion Tail, use the rules for that mutation if applicable.

Conversion beam projector.        
They can only be fired if the operator is stationary - the weapon will not work on board a moving vehicle. In order to ensure stability, troops using beamers are often equipped with special stabilizing boots and ground claws.
The weapon works by converting matter to energy, creating an energy field to its front. The energy field increases in intensity as the beam extends further. Initially, the field builds up very slowly - so that troops in the path of the beam can avoid it fairly easily. At its maximum extent the matter/energy conversion becomes so powerful as to cause a violent explosion. Normally this will be at a range of 80m. However any solid object which is in the path of the beam will feed the energy field causing a premature explosion - and a good deal of damage!
It takes 2 Full rounds to fire with the shot happening in the end of the 2nd round. Damage to the target hit is always Current Wounds + Armor + Toughness Bonus + 1, if you are hit with this it is not a question of if you are hurt but how bad. Additionally the denser the target hit the bigger the resulting blast. Because of the slow build up and the weapons sensitivity to movement it is hard it hit a moving target, usually it is aimed at a dense stationary target and the blast is used to cause secondary damage rather than hit something that moves. For every round a target has moved previous to being shot adds a +10 to the difficulty of the shooter.          

Distortion Cannon           
The Distortion Cannon, also known as the Displacer Cannon, Displacer, D-Cannon, Warp Cannon, or Warper, uses the same principle as a spacecraft's warpspace drives. The target is 'warped' slightly into hyperspace, and then back again. This occurs in an uncontrolled fashion, exposing the target to either the vacuum of space or the inferno of the heart of a sun, this automatically kills or destroys the target once a hit is scored.        
The only hope of avoiding the full effect of the weapon is to dive out of the main are before the distort field reaches full intensity. To represent this, targets which moved in previous turns add a +10 to the difficulty of the guns operator. If a shot missed only due to the difficulty modifiers of a moving target are still hit but not fully affected and are moved spatially 1d10 meters in a random direction.
