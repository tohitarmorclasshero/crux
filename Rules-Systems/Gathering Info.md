# Gathering Info
GATHERING INFORMATION

from Blades in the Dark

  

 The flow of information from the GM to the players about the fictional world is very important in a roleplaying game. By default, the GM tells the players what their characters perceive, suspect, and intuit. But there’s just too much going on to say everything—it would take forever and be boring, too. The players have a tool at their disposal to more fully investigate the fictional world.

 When you want to know something specific about the fictional world, your character can _gather information_. The GM will ask you _how_ your character gathers the info (or how they learned it in the past).

 If it’s common knowledge, the GM will simply answer your questions. If there’s an obstacle to the discovery of the answer, an action roll is called for. If it’s not common knowledge but there’s no obstacle, a simple fortune roll determines the quality of the information you gather.

 Each attempt to gather information takes time. If the situation allows, you can try again if you don’t initially get all the info that you want. But often, the opportunity is fleeting, and you’ll only get one chance to roll for that particular question.

 Some example questions are on the bottom of the character sheet. The GM always answers honestly, but with a level of detail according to the level of effect.

 The most common gather information actions are Surveying the situation to reveal or anticipate what’s going on and Studying a person to understand what they intend to do or what they’re really thinking.

 Sometimes, you’ll have to maneuver yourself into position before you can gather information. For example, you might have to Prowl to a good hiding place first and then Study the cultists when they perform their dark ritual.

  

INVESTIGATION

* You might _Attune_ to see echoes of recent spirit activity. _Have any new ghosts been here? How can I find the spirit well that’s calling to them? What should I be worried about?_

* You might _Command_ a local barkeep to tell you what he knows about the secret meetings held in his back room. _What’s really going on here? What’s he really feeling about this? Is he part of this secret group?_

* You might _Consort_ with a well-connected friend to learn secrets about an enemy, rival, or potential ally. _What do they intend to do? What might I suspect about their motives? How can I discover leverage to manipulate them?_

* You might _Hunt_ a courier across the city, to discover who’s receiving satchels of coin from a master duelist. _Where does the package end up? How can I find out who signed for the package at City Hall?_

* You might _Study_ ancient and obscure books to discover an arcane secret. _How can I disable the runes of warding? __Will anyone sense if they’re disabled?_

* Or you might _Study_ a person to read their intentions and feelings. _What are they really feeling? How could I get them to trust me?_

* You might _Survey_ a manor house to case it for a heist. _What’s a good point of infiltration? What’s the danger here?_

* Or you might _Survey_ a charged situation when you meet another gang. _What’s really going on here? Are they about to attack us?_

* You might _Sway_ a powerful lord at a party so he divulges his future plans. _What does he intend to do? How can I get him to think I might be a good partner in this venture?_

* Or you might _Sway_ his bodyguard to confide in you about recent events. _Where has he been lately? Who’s he been meeting with?_

  

GATHER INFORMATION

_Ask a question and make an action roll or a fortune roll. The GM answers you honestly, with a level of detail depending on the effect level._

* _Great_: You get exceptional details. The information is complete and follow-up questions may expand into related areas or reveal more than you hoped for.

* _Standard_: You get good details. Clarifying and follow-up questions are possible.

* _Limited_: You get incomplete or partial information. More information gathering will be needed to get all the answers.
