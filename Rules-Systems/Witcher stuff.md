CRAFTING
Why Should I Craft?
Craftsmen can be invaluable to a party’s success. Gear is expensive and repairing it saves time and money. It’s better to have someone who can make the sword you need for 3/5ths the normal cost and use that money for even more gear. And if that person can also fix the same sword when it breaks, you’ve got a real treasure on your hands. Crafting also lets you make the most of any recipes your party finds. There are new technologies to discover and old technologies lost to the ages to be recovered. A skilled craftsman can give a party amazing benefits like bombs and traps, blade oils, and runes to enchant their weapons. They say a weapon is only as good as the wielder; well that’s true – but it helps to have a quality weapon.
The process of crafting weapons, armor, enchantments, and traps breaks down into 3 simple steps:
1. Determine if you have the right diagram
2. Determine if you have the right components.
3. Make a crafting roll.

Determine If You Have The Diagram
For every tool you can make or buy, there’s a diagram that explains how to make it: what ingredients, how to refine them, and how to assemble it. You must either have the diagram memorized or have the physical diagram in front of you during the whole process. Diagrams always include the list of required ingredients. You can memorize as many recipes as you have points in Intelligence. Memorizing a recipe means that you can craft it without having the physical copy on hand.

Determine If You Have The Ingredients
Every diagram indicates the ingredients required to create the item. Unlike in Chemistry, you cannot substitute similar components for those in the diagram. You can’t make a sword out of cheese.

Make Your Crafting Roll
Crafting requires specific tools. It works like this:
- Crafting Tools allow you to craft Armor, Enchantments, Weapons, Traps, Glyphs, and Runes.
- Forges are required for any recipe with metal components. You can buy a tinker’s forge to work on the road.

Once you have the appropriate crafting tools you can begin. Each diagram lists how long it takes to craft and a difficulty for crafting the item. When crafting, tell the JUDGE that you take the required time. At the end of the required time, make the crafting roll; if you succeed, you have made the item. Otherwise, you did something wrong and the product is unusable.

Recovery (Optional)
You have 1 chance, directly after you fail your crafting roll, to salvage materials from the project. You can make another crafting check at the normal difficulty. If you succeed and spend half as many more components, you can create a flawed or lower quality similar item. If you don’t spend the material components, you can salvage 1 of the substances that you used in pure form.

Units
We use Units as an abstract measure of components. They tell you how many “doses” of a component you get from a given source/batch. The cost of buying a component shows you how much it is to buy 1 unit.

Foraging
You can make a Survival check at a DC based on the Forage DC of a a component to try and find it in the wilderness. You must be in the location where that component occurs. If you succeed, you find a number of units based on its quantity. The time required to forage for a component is decided by the GM based on the component’s rarity and the environment you are foraging in.
  
Disassembling Gear
When you disassemble gear you break it down into the components that made it. However, some of these components are damaged by the process: you gain half of each type of component back, minimum zero.

Salvage
You can’t fix gear if you don’t have it on hand. You don’t necessarily need all of the pieces but you need to have the base item.

Obtain the Materials
When re-crafting gear you need to add some of the original materials to fill in for broken pieces. To fix gear, gather 1 unit of each material listed in the original diagram.
Repairing gear requires all the same tools needed to make it initially.

Roll
When fixing gear you must make a crafting roll at a DC equal to the crafting DC of the item minus 5. For every rune/glyph/enchantment placed on the item, the DC goes up by 2. If you succeed at this check then the item is fixed. If you fail this roll, the item remains broken and the extra materials you added for repairs are used up. Unlike with regular crafting, you cannot attempt a recovery check.

CHEMISTRY
Chemistry depends on 9 special substances. You can extract the substances from many raw materials. Chemists will pick, dig, or hack off all kinds of things to get them.
- > vermilion = R-
- / rebis = Rn (copper)
- ^ fulgur = R+
- v aether = B-
- x hydragenum = Bn (silver)
- < vitriol = B+
- \ caelum = Y-
- | sol = Yn (gold)
- ~ quebrith = Y+

- B = Cyan
- R = Magenta
- Y = Yellow
- - = negative (light)
- n = neutral
- + = positive (dark)

(Count colors first, then balance charge.)

FAITHS

  

###### FREYA: The Raven Queen
Many local goddess cults -- always associated with fertility, harvest, love, & birth -- fused into the worship of the All Mother or Great Mother, the Raven Queen Freya, who still has many followers in the North today. The barbarians live close to nature and still organize themselves by tribe and clan, and Freya is part of their day-to-day lives. Freya’s worship is centered in Her favorite sacred grove called Indar, on Indarsal isle. Closeby stands the temple to Freya in Ellander where her warrior-virgin attendants see to her needs in the inner temple; few have been permitted entry in the last century.
Freya is also the patroness of prophetesses, seers, and telepaths. She herself can take the form of the raven who hears and sees the invisible.
Anyone in need -- for food, for peace, for courage, for patience -- can come to her. Her temple is well known for offering education in reading, writing, mathematics, ethics, history, and healing. Healers who train at the temple go wherever they’re needed. Freya is the goddess of the harvest as well; farmers & others who live off the land make offerings to her. Her goodwill is very important to people whose livelihood depends on the seemingly unpredictable whims of weather, drought, pests, & warriors. 
Unlike more organized faiths, Freya has few formal temples with frescoes or stained glass; her teachings are about pacifism, tolerance, forbearance, practicality, wit, & serving those in need. Her shrines are infrequent and simple, with offerings of fruit and flowers, and 3 typically wooden statues: maid, mother, and crone. She experiences all the ages of women & understands the problems of each, but her concerns go well beyond. There is no complex structure and no requests for donations.
Freya was the first teacher to humans, she revealed the secrets of magic to her bastard children, who became the Children of Winter -- the first shamans among the people, founding the Seeker school, who continue to seek wisdom and prophecy to this day.

The UNCONQUERED SUN
The church of the Eternal Flame symbolizes Light emerging from the Darkness, knowledge, and faith guiding the faithful. In the beginning they were tolerant of other faiths. Their original militant arm was the Order of the White Rose. As it grew in size and importance, the targets of the militants became more widespread. All users of forbidden magic became enemies of the Order, which blamed them for everything from wars to the weather. The first Grand Master renamed it the Order of the Flaming Rose when a white rose burst into flames in his hand; they became even more militant than before, leading some to suggest that his fanaticism had impaired his sanity.
After his death, the second Grand Master tempered the Order and changed the flaming rose to a rose wrapped in gold. Still, persecution continued. Recently the Order of Flaming Rose was disbanded, with some from the order remaining as secret police of the Great Church of the Unconquered Sun, others becoming witch hunters for hire, and more dispersed throughout the faith’s sphere of influence.
The faith of the Great and Unconquered Sun, the Golden Dawn, the Burning Phoenix, ties Avatar Tira Miron to nature and thus to the people. Long ago the people believed the Avatar was the sun incarnate. Backward villages still believe she’s the intermediary between the faithful and the forces of nature, and make burnt offerings to the sun at the solstices and equinoxes. At dusk, families gather together in homes and village centers to recite the Nights Prayer, asking the sun to return and make their lives & harvests abundant and to protect them from the horrors of the night.
In the cities the annual tax collectors go house to house distributing oranges and sun-shaped sweet cakes to symbolize the blessings of the Avatar and the Sun, and the promise of plenty in the coming year. It is the one day of the year when people are happy to see the taxman.

BESTIARY

Danger Ratings
The 2 parts of the danger rating help you know how difficult an encounter should be. The first part establishes generally how easy to fight the monster is:
**Easy**: Relatively easy for 1 well-trained soldier to kill 1-on-1. They should be used in hordes in most cases.
**Medium**: Should be used alone or along with a group of easy monsters.
**Hard**: Fit to be boss monsters. Should be used for climactic battles and (unless you have a very large or very skilled party) should show up alone.

If you want to get more granular than that, the second part of each monster’s rating (simple, complex, or difficult) establishes how difficult the monster is within its category:

**Simple**: Very straight forward and don’t take a lot of planning or preparation to fight.
**Complex**: Easier to fight with preparation, but don’t require it.
**Difficult**: Should only be taken on if you know about the monster; otherwise the battle will be punishing. Avoid using a difficult monster in an ambush, if you can.

**Necrophages**
Corpse eaters who frequent graves, battlefields, and deep caves. Their grisly appearance is misleading -- they’re living extraplanar creatures. The less intelligent necrophages such as ghouls will attack anything that comes near. Cunning ones like hags will stalk graveyards and lure away village folk.

**Specters**
Embody the powerful desires of the deceased. They usually come into existence when someone is murdered or dies in the throes of powerful emotion. While many seem to be intelligent, they are consumed with all-encompassing drives -- usually rage -- that make them almost impossible to reason with.

**Cursed Ones**
Creatures afflicted with a curse that transforms them into a monster. The most common cursed ones are werewolves. Since they’re humans who were cursed, cursed ones normally prowl around settlements. Most are actively hostile to humans.

**Hybrids**
Includes a myriad of chimeras such as sirens and griffons made up of an amalgamation of animal parts. Hybrids are incredibly varied and each prefer different habitats. Those that are capable of flight prefer high places, through hybrids can be found all over the world and in all environs.

**Elementa**
Creations of magic: golems, elementals, gargoyles, and the like. Most are conjured by a mage or priest. They follow orders and have little will of their own. However, when brought into this world without shackles, elementa are forces of chaos that can destroy cities.

**Relicts**
Forces of nature that come into existence in wilderness areas over time. Possibly these monsters came into our realm with the Conjunction. They’re all magical creatures with strong ties to the natural world. Relicts range from cunning and intelligent to primal and monstrous.

**Trolls**
Including ogres, nekkers, and giants; large humanoids often with almost-human intelligence. Most are large and bulky (nekkers being the exception) and they not only form basic tribal societies but also, in the case of ogre, can speak human languages.

**Draconids**
Includes creatures like wyverns, dragons, and thunder lizards. Large reptiles that are very dangerous (especially in melee) but feral. True dragons are as or more intelligent than humans and possess many more abilities. Draconids lair primarily in high places and mountains.

**Vampires**
Incredibly varied class of blood-drinking monsters. Vampires usually hunt in ruins, though powerful ones can thrive in cities. Lesser vampires are mindless beasts who tear bodies apart and slurp blood; higher forms can blend in seamlessly with humans and wield tremendous power.

**Drowners**
**Stats**: zombie.
**Loot**: drowner brain, drowner tongue, essence of water (d3). Drowner brains can be made into a delicious nutritious stew; supposedly an aphrodisiac.

**Ghoul**
**Stats**: ghoul.
**Loot**: ghoul marrow (d3), ghoul claws (2), venom extract (d3)

**Hag, Grave**
**Stats**: hag
**Loot**: hag ear (2), hag teeth (d3), venom extract (d6), random rune (1), strange possessions (d6)
**Whip Tongue**: 3d6+2 poison, 4m range; if you successfully parry a tongue attack with a blade, it’s severed: the hag takes 5 damage and can’t use its tongue again.
**Skull Circle**: 1hr ritual; hag gains advantage to all actions if within 100m of their skull circle.
**Command Undead**: As an action, can give simple orders to any necrophage within 20m.

**Wraith**
**Stats**: wraith
**Loot**: wraith essence (d3), spectre dust (d3), infused dust (d3)

**Noonwraith**
**Stats**: Nejavann noonwraith
**Loot**: wraith essence (d6), spectre dust (d6), infused dust (d6), light essence (d3)
**High Noon Dance**: as mirror image spell, plus drains 1hp per round from each target, healing the noonwraith by that amount.
**Dust Devil**: as blindness spell.

**Wolves & Wargs**
**Loot**: dog tallow (d6), wolf hide, wolf liver, beast bones (d6)
**Leader**: Wargs give other wolves +4 morale, and can command them.

**Loot**: werewolf pelt, werewolf saliva (d6), random items (d6)
