Trauma
PC retirement is a replacement for PC death, not an additional risk. I'm making death less likely in order to make retirement more likely. Retired characters are more interesting and more useful than dead ones -- and a lot less demoralizing.
For example, "... and then he bought a turnip farm and swore never to leave it" is more satisfying end to a character's story than "... and then he died in a filthy hole, and the rats nibbled his eyes until he was quite dead".
And of course, forcibly retiring a character still accomplishes the primary punitive aspect of dying: you lose the opportunity to play your character.
Whenever you have a near-death experience (fail death save) you can choose to survive, but gain a point of Trauma and put a question mark next to it (if a question mark isn't there already).
Whenever you return to place where your character could conceivably retire, erase the question mark and roll a d20. If you roll equal-or-less than your Trauma score, your character decides to retire. You cannot stop them.
The player can dictate the conditions of the retirement. They are free to give away their magic items if they wish; they will have no need of them in their new life as a turnip farmer. They are also free to retire penniless if they desire; surely a beggar will have a longer life than those fools venturing back down into the maw of the earth. (But see Retirement, below.)
Give them a bonus to this roll if they are on an Epic Quest and are deeply invested in it. They're more than just a mere murderhobo.
Give them a penalty to this roll if the retirement is especially tempting. If a grateful king offers the hobbit a bucolic tobacco plantation, for example.
