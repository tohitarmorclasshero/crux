# Downtime

Crafting
A character with the appropriate tools but no proficiency can still make simple items, but not fine or masterwork items.  
Materials run out with a normal Usage die, d6. Restocking can be done at any settlement for a cost of 50$.

Haberdashery  
Haberdashery is a profession as old as time, and any self-respecting worthy wouldn't be caught dead without a fashionable headpiece or the newest style cape.
To make a piece requires a number of successes equal to its complexity. Simple garments require only 1 or 2 successes, but fine clothes might require 5 or 6. Additional Raises can be forwarded to inherent bonuses in the garment to Charisma checks.  
  
Investments  
Make money! Choose something to invest in (or make a startup!) and we'll work out whether you're making a stable, risky, or wild investment. Higher risks mean higher returns... but higher chance it goes bust. Pro tip: hire an accountant.  
  
Magic Research  
Get more spells! Can spend time and money gaining spells, or creating scrolls and potions. Costs available on request.  

Construction  
Build! Create buildings and fortresses of your very own. Land must be acquired first. List of costs available on request, upkeep costs and land taxes apply. Takes a day per 1k$ value of the property, spend more to speed up construction. Takes 3x longer if you're not around during the week; contractors, amirite?  

Carousing  
Get wasted! The bigger the town, the more you can spend! Save vs poison (wisdom) to avoid rolling on the "What The Fuck Did I Do Last Night" table.  

Settlement|Carousing
-|-
Village|1d6 x 1k$
Town|2d6 x 2k$
City|3d6 x 4k$

Money Changing & Fences  
You don't delve into the earth to plumb it for copper pieces and gold coins. Instead, you emerge, battered and shaken, with 1,351 coins from the lost Cisterian empire. Or perhaps you return from the Bugbear lair with the a Duke's own personal land grants, or you "came into possession" of some pricey art objects from a temporarily abandoned noble plaza that you'd like to offload. Here we find no generic points of wealth, but valuable loot with a story attached to it.  
As the greater part of society operates on barter, the characters will need to find a buyer for their precious take, which is to say that the valuables themselves do not necessarily hold inherent value as currency. Inn-keepers and armorers can do little with such moneys as they rarely take payments in specie, and flashing strange coins and valuables around would likely raise the immediate unwanted attention of the local lord looking for additional alternative tax revenues.  
Rather, the characters are well-advised to seek a local money-changer or fence; someone who buy the storied cache in exchange for a cut and credit in the local town, city or region. Once the characters have successfully laundered their ill-gotten fortune, they will have full financing for their extravagant lifestyle and material acquisitions.  
For example, the players return with 80 only-slightly soiled tapestries of southern Kushite origin. After some negotiating back-and-forth, the major money-lender in the city agrees to purchase half of them for 22,000$ in credit, good throughout the province. This credit advance is probably in the form of some local currency or perhaps a standing tab or even endorsed cheque--a detail that is given a considerable amount of hand-wavium to gloss over the trivialities.  
Importantly however, this credit does not carry over into different regions easily, meaning the characters would be wise to only sell what they need to of their hard-won treasure.  
What does this actually do differently than the traditional copper/silver/gold piece system? Firstly, it introduces a level of mystery when the treasure trove is seen for the first time. Secondly, it further requires a little haggling when it comes time to pawn the riches off (which allows more GM control and even further adventure opportunities). Thirdly, it gives each treasure a story of how it got there (and certainly the Duke will demand his land-grants back after the party recovers them). Fourth, it ties wealth to the locale, without requiring the referee to adumbrate an entire global economy to explain why. Finally, tying wealth to location further interfaces with the Settlement Warrant and Law systems.
