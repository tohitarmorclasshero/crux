# Recovered Armor
Recovering Armor

When someone is slain, the armor they wear ends up pierced, dented, and otherwise compromised. Armor recovered from a fallen foe or ally has a 1in4 chance of being useless. It can be repaired by an armorer, typically for 3/5ths or 4/5ths the original cost.

Demi-humans are of an unusual physiognomy and cannot wear armor sized for a human. If not otherwise specified, thereâ€™s a 3in4 chance that randomly discovered armor is human-sized.
