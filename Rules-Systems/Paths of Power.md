# Paths of Power

Paths are bodies of knowledge that are kept in colleges, where the initial stepping stones are passed down from masters to students. Colleges are founded to pursue certain forms of magic; to follow a path, a mage either must research each step on their own or join a guild or college. Because each mage’s guild is devoted to certain paths, the DM can limit player choices in a logical way (“They don’t teach the Path of the Mind at the Guild of Seven Stars”), but this also gives the player a chance to either accept the DM’s ruling (“I guess I’ll keep going to the guild anyway”) or take on new goals for more quests and adventures. (“We need to find another guild“).

#### Learning Magic Step by Step
What are the paths of power? In the game, they are sequences of related spells that must be learned in a particular order, from lowest to highest level. If a path contains more than one spell of a certain level, the mage only needs to learn one of those spells in order to progress further along the path.

Each step on the path of power depends on understanding the principles behind previous steps; that is, a mage can never learn a spell if they haven't mastered the previous spells on that path. Spells are arranged in sequences of required learning, like the rungs of a ladder. For instance, before a mage on the path of Greater Fire can cast a fireflow spell (L3), theh must be able to cast at least 1 of the 3 2nd-level spells preceding it on this path: Agannazar’s scorcher, burning hands, or pyrotechnics.

Pursuing magic along paths opens many choices, for a mage on a path always automatically has the foundational knowledge about the next spell on a path when they reach the experience level that allows them to cast it. No more need to rummage through dusty tomes with all the dignity of a looter on a battlefield; no need for expensive teachers and colleges or guild dues and good standing. 

A mage rolls the chance to learn a spell whenever they wish (assuming they have access to that spell level). If a path is frustrated in one direction, they may be able to approach it from another direction (if the path contains more than one spell of the same level), or they may try again to learn the next spell when gaining another level.

Paths of power that contain 4 or
more spells are commonly called “roads”, but in general there is no system for naming paths. Many of the paths of power described below are given different names in different lands: the Trickster’s Road is known as Loki’s Path among the Norse, and Hermes’ Path near Mount Olympus. Be creative in choosing your own names and your own forks in the roads.

#### Greater and Lesser Paths
All paths belong to one of two categories, simple or complex. The distinction between the two is simply a matter of whether a path includes one or more 1st-level spells. Simple paths, the ones that contain first-level spells, are the paths that all mages must start on. Their names are printed in bold type in the lists of paths given later.

The shorter paths that begin with higher-level spells are referred to as Complex paths, for they are not as simple or as extensive as the simple paths. Only more powerful mages travel these paths, since they include no first-level spells.

#### Skipping Steps
As a wizard progresses along a path, they build a foundation of knowledge, formulas, and techniques for the magic of the path. Once they know spells from two or more consecutive spell levels on a greater path, they may skip one step farther along on the path. For example, a wizard on the Eagle’s Road already knows feather fall (first level) and ride the wind (second level). They may then skip one step (the third-level fly spell) and learn spectral wings (fourth level).

Only one spell level can be skipped on any path, and only on greater paths. However, it is possible to go back and fill in a step that had been skipped earlier. In the example, the wizard could learn fly after originally skipping it in favor of spectral wings, and then, if he so chose, he could skip another step farther along the path -- passing over vortex, for instance, and learning Bloodstone’s spectral steed as his next spell on this path.

#### How Many Paths Can One Mage Follow?
The number of paths a mage can travel on depends on both experience level and Intelligence. Path magic requires a new set of assumptions about how many spells a mage can learn. The Intelligence Table in the Player’s Handbook defines the maximum number of spells of a certain level that a wizard character can know. But spells in paths are not neatly arranged by level; they cross and intersect and clog that system.

| Level | Max Paths |
| ------------ | --------- |
| 1-4 | 2 |
| 5-7 | 3 |
| 8-9 | 4 |
| 10 | 5 |

Chance to learn a new spell: 
= INT check (DC10+Spell Complexity)

#### Completing a Path
If a wizard learns every spell in a path, the path is completed, and it no longer counts against their max allowable number of paths. This rule makes archmages very powerful indeed; they can learn more spell paths by completing prior ones, thus dodging the “Max number of Paths” limitations. In addition, they can learn new paths very quickly (by making an unbroken series of successful learning rolls), much more quickly than a less experienced mage could gather all the formulae from spell books and grimoires hidden in obscure corners of the campaign. In general though, paths become less and less limiting at higher levels, since the archmage knows almost everything there is to know about the arcane arts; new paths are less challenging because of their similarities to spells they've already mastered.

#### Forgetting Steps
Powerful mages on a path may know so much about a certain set of spells that they have nothing more to learn on that road. They also may know so many basic spells that they cannot begin any new paths because of Intelligence or level limits on the number of spells they can learn. One way around the problem is to simply forget the first steps on other paths; once a mage has mastered the simplest forms of magic, they may not need access to those spells any longer.

Forgetting part of a spell path requires spells on that path; only one spell can be forgotten, and it must be the lowest-level spell on the path. Forgetting a spell eliminates all knowledge of the spell from the mage’s memory and opens a spell slot. Forgotten spells do not count against a mage when he attempts to skip steps at the high-level end of the path.

#### Forking Paths
When paths of power intersect, the wizard learning the paths has 3 choices: they may continue to follow only the path they began with and ignoring the intersection; they can switch from one path to the other and abandon the chance of any further progress on the first path; or they can pursue both paths by declaring that they will follow a forking path. These forking paths offer a wizard more options than just a straight line because they can learn spells from either path as they gains more levels, but each “branch” of the fork still counts as a separate path for purposes of determining how many paths a wizard can follow.

Some spells are listed on more than one path; there’s more than one way to learn many of the arts of magic, after all. Spells that intersect at the crossroads of two or more paths are called nexus spells. First-level spells are never nexus spells. To jump the track and switch from one path to another at a nexus point, the mage must know about the existence of both paths. Once they switch tracks on a forked path, they can no longer skip any spells beyond the nexus spell; this is only part of the price they pay for forking the path. If they abandon one path entirely (either by forgetting or completing it), they may skip spells on the second forking path normally.

#### Two-way Travel
Although paths are generally meant to be followed from beginning to end (from lowest- to highest-level spell), there is nothing to prevent a wizard from “backtracking” to learn a lower-level spell they did not already know. In fact, this is what happens when a wizard fills in a step along a path that they had earlier skipped (see “Skipping steps”). The same sort of “filling in” can be done for the sake of picking up a spell that didn’t have to be learned earlier (in the case of a path containing more than one spell of a certain level), and for the sake of acquiring lower-level spells along a path that the wizard began to follow at a nexus point (see Forking paths above). A wizard may not often find it useful to engage in this backtracking, but it can be done if so desired.

#### Paths of Power
In the following lists, the spells in each path are given in the order they must be learned. The level of a spell is indicated by the number in parentheses following it.

#### New Spells
The following spells affect paths directly, forming by themselves a sort of “Path of Paths.” Because they strike at the root of a path wizard’s power, they should be extremely rare -- and extremely feared. Any mage using them indiscriminately will soon find himself hunted by other wizards.

Close path (Abjuration)
Level: 3
Range: 10’/level
Components: V, S, M (small silver key worth at least 50gp, broken during casting)
Duration: 1 day
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: 1 wizard
Saving Throw: Neg. 
Closes a mage’s access to a path they normally can follow. This bars access to one path (chosen randomly), for the remainder of the day. Spells already memorized aren't forgotten; the wizard simply can’t access them. The caster does not know which spell or spells are barred from the target (if any). After next sunrise, the target may memorize and cast spells of the closed path again normally.

Seal path (Abjuration) Reversible
Level: 5
Range: 10’/level
Components: V, S, M (a seal made of specialty lead/mithril alloy inscribed with victim’s truename worth no less than 1000gp)
Duration: Permanent until dispelled
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: 1 wizard
Saving Throw: Neg.
The wizard affected can learn no more spells in a path (chosen by the caster from among those the caster knows the target follows) until this magical roadblock is removed. If the target fails the saving throw by 5 or more, they also suffer the effects of a close path spell affecting the same path for the remainder of the day. If the target makes the save by more than 5, they may reflect the spell back at the caster. The caster is entitled to a saving throw against the weakened, reflected spell with +Adv. The spell cannot be reflected more than once. The seal on the chosen path can only be removed by an open path spell (the reversed form of seal path), a limited wish, or a wish spell.

Burn path (Necromancy/Abjuration)
Level: 8
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M (a scroll of thin beaten gold inscribed with the formula for the spell that serves as the path’s starting point costing no less than 3000gp and consumed in the casting)
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 8
Area of Effect: 1 wizard
Saving Throw: See below
Destroys all knowledge a mage has of one path chosen by the caster. Spells and formulas are all instantly forgotten, memorized spells vanish from the victim’s mind, and all spells on that path must be relearned as if the victim never knew them. The effect cannot be reversed, but if the target’s saving throw succeeds, the path is merely sealed as per a seal path spell. The spell cannot be reflected.

#### Path Masters
A wizard’s expertise with any given path improves if he has mastered the path. To become a master of a path, a wizard must know every single spell available to him in that given path -- that is, every spell of a level he can cast. So long as he retains mastery, the master casts all of those spells more effectively. The benefits of mastery are simple: his spells gain a -1 saving throw modifier, a +1 bonus per die of damage, and range, duration, and area of affect are all as if the path master were one level higher than his actual level. He loses mastery only if he chooses not to learn a spell of that path when he gains an experience level, if he fails his roll to learn a spell of the path, or if he chooses to forget or skip a spell.

A wizard may never be a master of
more than a single path at any time, but if he fulfills all the requirements for mastery in more than one path, the player may choose which path the wizard is a master of. The wizard may switch his choice of mastery whenever he learns a new spell in either path.

#### Wiping Away Paths
As an optional rule, paths that a wizard ignores may atrophy because the skills required are not kept up. Here’s the formula: If a wizard has not learned any new spells in a path by the time he finishes the experience level when two or more new steps have become available to him, his skill in that path stalls at the lowest level required to cast the spells he does know. For example, consider a wizard following the Stone Road who has attained 7th level -- the point at which he becomes able to cast a fourth-level spell. If that wizard has not learned the third-level spell Maximillian’s stony grasp or either of the fourth-level spells stoneskin or dig by the time he reaches 8th level, his progress on that path is forfeited, and thereafter he casts fist of stone and Maximillian’s earthen grasp (the first- and second-level spells on the path) as if he were only a 3rd-level mage (since he has contented himself with casting only first- and second-level spells from the path). If a third step of spells becomes available and is ignored (wall of stone or stone shape in this example), the path is entirely forgotten.

#### Lost paths
The DM may designate one or more paths as lost, meaning that they are not available to most mages. Paths named after famous mages or monsters are especially good for this. Recovering and restoring such a path may become an adventuring goal for player characters.

Furthermore, particular settings may require their own paths: the provinces of sand, sea, flame, and wind in the AL-QADIM setting certainly can be the basis of several good paths, because the elemental magics of that setting are even more carefully defined and interwoven than in the AD&D core rules (see “Customized campaign paths” below). The genies’ paths can easily be constructed using spells from the Secrets of the Lamp sourcebox, and elementalist characters will appreciate these paths as well.

In a FORGOTTEN REALMS campaign, the spells of the many powerful mages should serve as starting points for paths: Elminster’s, Snilloc’s, and the Simbul’s magics are all unique. These paths are given below as examples, but many others could be made to suit individual tastes and the needs of powerful mage characters and the DM’s wishes for a campaign.

Bigby’s, Leomund’s, and Mordenkainen’s paths are surely more common in the WORLD OF GREYHAWK setting -- where they were invented -- than anywhere else. These individual variations are always up to the DM.

### Sample Lost Paths

Lolth’s Road, or Road of Webs (simple): spidereyes (1, DU), spider climb (1), darkness 15’ radius (2), skyhook (2, DU), web (2), dark wings (3, DU), hand of darkness (3, DU), infravision (3), passweb (5, DU), summon spider (6, DU), vipergout (6, DU), death spider (8, DU), black blade of disaster (9, DU)

Snilloc’s Path (simple): Snilloc’s snowball (1, FA), Snilloc’s snowball storm (2, FA), Snilloc’s major missile (5, FA)

Simbul’s Path (simple): hypnotize (1), forget (2), suggestion (3), the Simbul’s synostodweomer (7, FA), steal enchantment* (7)

While path magic is intended for a traditional fantasy setting, it isn’t limited to that style of play. Sure, the lost paths of Toril could include the Road of Southern Magic of the Old Empires, or the magic of the elves of Evermeet, or the lost magic of Myth Drannor, or the forbidden fire magics of the Red Wizards of Thay. But much more exotic roads can be created if there are wizards willing to walk them. The dragons of Athas surely have their own powerful magics of desert survival. The PLANESCAPE setting could easily have Roads of Law and Chaos, and a Road of the Abyss. Each world will have its own magical traditions and cultures, but the pattern and system of magic presented here can readily be adapted to suit your preferences.

#### Traditions
For long-term campaigns or for developing campaign history, players and DMs may want to consider making magic traceable, that is, making certain masters and schools known for specializing in certain forms of magic. Though this doesn’t reveal exactly what spells an NPC wizard has on hand, it does give player characters a general idea of what they can expect -- in this sense it functions as a mechanic that presents a sort of NPC reputation to the players. For example, it allows characters to learn a great deal about potential allies or enemies by knowing something about the character (“Old Zeb, sure, he’s the student of Zackary, who was the arch-chancellor of Geoffry College. Everybody knows they’re all enchanters, councilors, divining, and dragon mages.“) At the DM’s option, characters with the Arcana skill may know the origin and academic genealogy of many of the paths of power, giving the PCs a valuable clue about what they may be up against.

Although this might seem like an unfair advantage, the knowledge cuts in both directions. After all, these rules are meant to encourage players and DMs to act more like the mages of fantasy literature do. Player characters may be the sons and daughters of well-known lineages, the offspring of a mage’s house, with all the expected mage’s blood and mage’s gifts. As a result, players may be reluctant to reveal their true identities for fear of giving valuable information about the character’s skills: and isn’t that what fantasy mages are all about?

#### Creating New Paths
Players will soon want their characters to create spell paths of their own, but this is a difficult undertaking for any but the most powerful. To create a new path, a PC wizard must list all the elements for the path, that is, all the spells that would comprise it -- and the character must be able to cast all of them. The elements of the list must have some common bond: a certain school of magic, the form that the spells all take, their function, the spells’ inventor, or the like. If the DM approves, the wizard can begin researching. The cost of “path research” is the total number of spell levels in the path times 1000gp, and the time required is one week per each spell level in the path. The chance of success is DC10 plus the mage’s (class level plus Int, minus number of spell levels on the road, minus ten, times five). For example, if an 10th-level mage with Int18 attempted to create a Path of Ice using the Snilloc’s spells (eight total levels), ice storm, and wall of ice (both fourth-level spells), the total levels would be 16, the cost would be 16,000gp, the total time required would be 16 weeks, and the chance of success would be 10+18-16=12-10=2x5=10+Base10=DC20. Researching paths is a chancy business at best, but a mage can keep trying over and over until they run out of money.

Usually, a mage will invent a new path only to accommodate newly researched spells; most new spells can simply be assigned to existing paths based on similarity (for instance, a new series of skiing, water walking, and airwalking spells might require a new path). This does not mean that the newly researched spell is immediately available to all other wizards; paths are traditional series of spells, and mages learn of these newly researched spells only slowly, as their inventor and his guild popularize the spells involved. Eventually, when the spell is widely known, it is adopted as part of the path. By then, the inventor is usually long dead.

#### Customized Campaign Paths
As samples of detailed, specialized paths for a campaign, examine the following lists for the AL-QADIM setting and the multiple paths for the necromancer. The Arabian Adventures rule book describes the category of universal spells; these spells are included in the paths presented earlier in this article, as are the more general spells from the Complete Sha’ir’s Handbook. The more specific spell paths detailing the four elemental provinces of Zakhara are listed below.
