With this variant system, a character who has the Spellcasting feature uses spell points instead spell slots to fuel spells. Spell points give a caster more flexibility, at the cost of greater complexity.
In this variant, each spell has a point cost equal to it’s level. Cantrips don't require spending spell points, but you must invest a spell point into a cantrip to have it available.
Instead of gaining a number of spell slots to cast your spells from the Spellcasting feature, you gain a pool of spell points instead. You expend a number of spell points to cast a spell. You can't reduce your spell point total to less than 0, and you regain all spent spell points when you finish a long rest.
Your level determines the maximum-level spell slot you can use. Even though you might have enough points to create a slot above this maximum, you can't do so.
This system can be applied to monsters that cast spells using spell slots, but it isn't recommended that you do so. Tracking spell point expenditures for a monster can be a hassle.
