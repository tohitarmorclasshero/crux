# Initiative
Initiative  
 All combatants describe their actions at the beginning of the round and, if any actions conflict, the player must roll against (10+Cr) in order to get their action off first.  
 If the sequence of actions is obvious (like ranged versus melee attacks), no dice are needed.

Action Sequence
1. Reactions
2. Cantrips/Fast Ranged Attacks
3. Slow Ranged Attacks
4. Reach weapons
5. Fast Melee Attacks
6. Slow Melee Attacks
7. Simple Spells (0-1 component)
8. Advanced Spells (2 components)
9. Complex Spells (3+ components)
