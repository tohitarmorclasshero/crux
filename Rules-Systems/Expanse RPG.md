## The Churn
Even when you're on a job handling 1 complication after another, the unexpected can happen, & happen fast. These events are dangerous more often than not, & always seem to happen at just the wrong time. & when you think things are bad, they get really bad, like how stopping a rampant alien infection becomes about chasing a rapidly accelerating asteroid before it hits Earth; kinda bad.
Sometimes you can still breeze through it. Other times, it engulfs you. There's lots of names for it: karma, mojo, bad juju, fate. Here we call it The Churn. If you want to have the effects of one of the more pervasive elements of the setting, the following is available as an optional rule for use in your campaign.

The Churn Pool
To use the concept of the Churn, the GM keeps track of what's called the Churn Pool. It represents a buildup of events during an adventure, where every twist & turn adds weight to the Churn, that swirl of fickle fate that eventually boils over & bites the heroes right in the tail.
At the beginning of each adventure, the Churn Pool is "reset", starting at zero. Add 1 each time one of the following events occurs:
- a character succeeds on an ability test with a 6 on the Drama die
- a character spends 4 or more stunt points to perform a stunt
- the characters successfully overcome an encounter or hazard
- a character spends Fortune points to alter a die roll
- the characters complete a section of the adventure

Table: Churn Over (1d6)
Churn Pool | 1-3   | 4-6
-----------|-------|-
10         | Minor | None
20         | Major | Minor

When the Churn Pool reaches 10, & 20, roll 1d6 & consult the Churn Over table.
The Churn Pool then continues building. When it reaches 30, an Epic Effect occurs automatically (no roll required) & the pool "resets" to zero & starts building again.

#### Minor Event
The characters face a setback, a minor complication that makes things more difficult for them. Examples include: 
**Challenge**: A character automatically fails an ability check, or has to make a second, follow-up check, to complete a task.
**Hazard**: A new hazard appears, or an existing hazard increases +1 level.
**Investigation**: It takes an additional test or special circumstance to unlock a clue.
**Social**: An NPC's attitude shifts -1 step less favorable or can only be maintained through extra effort from the characters.

#### Major Event
The characters have to deal with a more serious setback, such as: 
**Challenge**: An existing threat increases to the next rank (normal to Elite, etc. see Chapter 13: Threats). The crew has to go through an unexpected challenge test.
**Hazard**: A new hazard appears, or an existing hazard increases +2 levels. The crew suffers a Loss to their ship (see Losses under Space Combat, Chapter 6).
**Investigation**: Opposing forces are alerted to the investigation & misdirect it so an additional lead or clue must be investigated to progress.
**Social**: An NPC's attitude shifts -2 steps less favorable or can only be maintained by performing a difficult task. An NPC learns a secret detrimental to the characters. The PCs make a new Minor Enemy.

#### Epic Events
Things go completely pear-shaped. A whole new threat enters the story, & its worse than whatever the crew is already dealing with. Examples include: 
**Challenge**: A test can only succeed at significant cost, sacrificing lives, valuables, or status. A new Epic adversary enters the plot, or an existing adversary is upgraded to that level.
**Hazard**: A new Murderous Hazard enters the plot, or an existing hazard is upgraded to that level.
**Investigation**: The investigation leads to a trap, where characters might be ambushed, framed, or otherwise seriously harmed.
**Social**: An NPC with a favorable attitude becomes Hostile or an unfavorable one becomes Hostile. An NPC learns a secret that could be disastrous for the characters.

### Describing the Churn
Though the Churn has a rules-based method, the effects should be presented in-game with their own storied flavor, depending on the stage & effect. For example, if a character is firing their pistol & subject to a minor Churn effect, they might end up
stepping on a loose floor panel, whereas if they were subject to an epic effect, their shot might ricochet into a power conduit that explodes & punctures the outer hull. Now the crew has a sabaka problem! The effects given on the previous page are just guidelines & suggestions, & the GM should feel free to improvise suitable additional effects as suits the story.

#### The Story Within the Churn
Another way to utilize Churn effects is to plan ahead for when they might occur. You can even tailor your own effects directly connected to the story or game you’re running, using the table as a guideline. These rules are meant primarily to add flavor, challenge, & additional story elements for the enjoyment of everyone at the table. You may even wish to reward your players with a recovery of Fortune points if they handle the Churn event skillfully, or present creative ideas or great roleplaying.
It is not meant to punish players or be malicious, but to keep the game interesting & challenging.

Option: Dead-to-Rights
If you want a slightly more lethal Expanse game, consider the following option: In any situation where one character has another “dead-to-rights,” the target character cannot spend Fortune to eliminate damage. All damage must be accounted for with Toughness, injuries, or wounds, & any excess results in the character being taken out, as usual. Standard situations where a character is dead-to-rights include being completely surprised by an attack (such as shot by an unseen sniper, for example) or having the helpless condition, completely unable to avoid an attack or hazard. It’s up to you to define situations that leave a character dead-to-rights, & to tell the players in advance. For example, if you want them to respect guns a good deal more, make it clear that someone holding a gun on you means they have you dead-to-rights, unless you can somehow distract their attention. This means characters will probably be less likely to rush armed opponents, for example.
Try not to use this option as an excuse to arbitrarily kill off the Player Characters in a surprise fashion, but instead as a tool to help the players make informed decisions about the risks their characters are taking.

Morale
In many games combat is an all or nothing affair. Opponents fight until one side or the other is wiped out. War is indeed bloody, but it’d be infinitely more so if it was prosecuted in this way. In truth, most combats end when the morale of one side breaks & its combatants flee or surrender. Most combat in The Expanse is against NPC adversaries who have at least some sense of self-preservation. You can simulate this with INT(Morale) tests if you wish. Characters who fail a test attempt to break off from combat or even surrender.
When is it appropriate to test Morale? That is up to you, but consider making a test under the following conditions:
- when more than 1/2 are taken out of the fight
- when the leader or champion is taken out of the fight
- when fighting on will clearly mean being trapped or surrounded
- when other side reveals serious or overwhelming advantage

You can handle this one of two ways. Your first option is to make one INT(Morale) test for the side using the Wisdom of its leader (or best available if there is no clear leader). This has the advantage of being simple & can end a combat with one die roll. Your other option is to roll once for each major NPC & group of minor NPCs. This can mean some combatants flee while others stand & fight.
In general you want to use morale tests with NPCs only. Players should have the choice of whether their characters fight or flee in a given situation.

Impact Hazards
Falling in an environment with variable or microgravity is often more an issue of impact. As they say, it’s not the fall, it’s the sudden stop (or change in inertia) that hurts. An impact roughly equivalent to a short fall (3 to 4 meters) in 1 g is around 2d6 damage, while longer falls do more damage, up to 6d6. In some situations, characters can make a Dexterity (Acrobatics) test to halve the damage from an impact by rolling with it & landing to absorb some of the shock. Some “impacts” result from sudden changes in acceleration, throwing characters hard against the bulkheads of ships or stations. Generally, acceleration couches mitigate this (although see Acceleration, previously) but someone who isn’t strapped in when a ship suddenly accelerates, decelerates, or maneuvers can suffer damage equivalent to a serious fall.

Adversaries
Hauling goods across the Belt isn’t always safe. Heading through the seedier parts of a station’s lower decks is even more risky, & forget not being ready for a fight if you’re stirring up trouble with the local gangs or any of the factions. Dangerous people stand in the way of the characters in The Expanse. The NPCs the crew are likely to come into conflict with are known as adversaries or antagonists.
Adversaries come in many forms, & pose different dangers depending on their roles in the story & their level of antagonism toward the protagonists. This chapter contains a selection of adversaries from all lifestyles to include in a campaign.
These are starting points; use them as templates to design your own. Feel free to make them stronger or weaker, or alter anything else. The selection below ranges from the everyday to the weird, to suit a variety of campaigns.

Stats Format
Adversary game statistics appear in a standard format, encompassing their descriptions, abilities, focuses, talents, common equipment, & favored stunts. Not every adversary of the type described should use every stunt listed, & the GM should feel free to utilize any stunt if the story dictates its need.

Adversary Creation Guidelines
The adversaries in this chapter do not necessarily conform to the same rules as Player Characters. That’s the case for nonplayer characters in general & especially for non-human adversaries like drones, robots, or creations of the proto-molecule.
As GM, you can create adversaries & NPCs using the same character creation guidelines the players use for their characters if you like, but you don’t need to do it this way. You can also simply assign whatever abilities, focuses, talents, & stunts you deem appropriate for any non-player character. Adversaries & other supporting characters don’t need to meet the same prerequisites as Player Characters for talents, specializations, or other game traits, either.

Adversary Focus
Adversaries use the same ability focuses as the protagonists, except in cases where the adversaries are non-humans requiring special attacks. Most protagonists will be unable to take these focuses, unless something bizarre occurs during a campaign rendering a character more likely to brandish claws instead of a gun, for example.

Adversary Threat Level | PC Level Range
Minor | 1-4
Moderate | 5-8
Major | 9-12
Dire | 13-17
Legendary | 18-20

Adversary Threat
To help a GM find the most suitable adversary for the players’ party, each adversary receives a descriptive threat level from Minor all the way to Legendary. The Adversary Threat table tells you the typical Player Character level required for an adversary of a given threat level to present a mid-range to tough combat challenge, or be a general foil in a story. The threat level below that rank would be an easy challenge; the threat level above it is especially dangerous, & best suited to major enemies.
Threat is a general indicator of danger, but you can customize adversaries to the situation at hand. A soldier is an intimidating threat in the best of situations: drilled, fit, & armed to the teeth. Consider how the threat level might change if the soldier is drunk, is already wounded, has only one bullet for his rifle, or lacks orders from headquarters.
Additionally, Player Character preparedness, weapons, & skills may affect an antagonist’s threat level. A physically impressive character might beat down a threat in a street fight, while a reclusive lab technician takes a beating, instead. The different Player Characters see the opposing thug as a threat at various levels. Conversely, a scientist may outfox a saboteur attacking the station, while his brawler buddy can do little more than stand watch. GMs should be aware of the characters’ individual capabilities & any significant abilities or equipment that might make them more or less effective against a particular adversary.
Also note that threats at the lower range of the threat level are more likely to appear in small groups—as many there are members of the crew, even—while threats at the top of the range tend to appear singly, alongside an inferior or two or, rarely, in pairs.

Adversary Improvement
The stats presented in this chapter are average for an adversary of that type but you can change them to be tougher or more competent. It’s a simple matter to modify the weapons & armor of many adversaries to create different tactical challenges:
A Soldier or Veteran becomes a whole different class of foe equipped with power armor, for example! (See Power Armor in Chapter 4 for details.) If you want a tougher, more capable adversary, you can also modify the stats however you wish. We recommend the following adjustments:
- **Elite Adversary**: To make an adversary a little tougher than average, add 1 to any three abilities, add two focuses, & increase Fortune by 5. You can also make the NPC a novice in a new talent or add a degree
to an existing talent.
- **Heroic Adversary**: To make an adversary who is highly capable, add 2 to any two abilities, add 1 to any three other abilities, add four focuses, & increase Fortune by 15. You can also make the NPC a novice in 2 new talents or add +2 degrees to existing ones.
- **Epic Adversaries**: To make an adversary who is extremely potent, add 3 to one ability, 2 to any two other abilities, & 1 to any three others. Add five focuses, increase the adversary’s Fortune by 20, & increase armor rating by 2 or more. You can also add three degrees to new or existing talents.

Social Adversaries
Adversaries & other NPCs with a social focus raise the question of their effectiveness. Use their social abilities—particularly Communication & Willpower—as a benchmark for how they interact with other NPCs. In most cases, dice rolls aren’t necessary; look at the relevant statistics & ongoing story, then decide how it will work out. When it comes to NPCs performing social actions against PCs, see Social Encounters in Chapter 5, particularly Social Rules for Player Characters.
Generally, social adversaries should have social ability scores (including relevant focuses) about the same as the Player Characters, adding +1 for each adversary improvement (Elite, Heroic, & Epic) with Epic social adversaries also having a +3 bonus for two or three of their relevant social ability focuses.
Adversaries generally don’t have Resources scores, but have wealth described in rough, real-world terms. They can acquire whatever seems reasonable for their wealth & fits the needs of the story. Use this guideline for other game rules when it makes sense to overlook them when it comes to non-player characters. A simple description is often enough.

Option: Minor Adversaries
At the GM’s option, minor adversaries (those unimportant to the story & not intended to be a major challenge for the crew) can be considered to have Fortune scores of 0, unable to spend Fortune to reduce the effects of damage. This means minor adversaries are entirely reliant on Toughness, injuries, & wounds, & odds are good that 2–3 dice of damage will take them out. This is a good option for when you don’t want to track a lot of adversary Fortune scores & just need to know if a minor adversary is injured, wounded, or taken out.

## Relationships
Where honorifics describe how the world reacts to a character, & memberships in organizations model that character’s connection to large groups of people, relationships represent more intimate connections. Such relationships may be deliberately cultivated or the result of larger forces beyond a character’s control, but all relationships are personal & intimate, to some degree.
Relationships should ideally form during play, arising from how a character treats another individual over time. Recurring non-player characters can provide memorable opportunities for roleplaying, & those experiences can be made more enjoyable by basing them on ongoing relationships. From the surly mechanic who regularly works on the crew’s ship, to the annoyingly cheery security chief who routinely tosses one of them in the drunk tank, relationships should form naturally & mean something to the NPCs & PCs alike.
In addition to those that grow out of roleplaying, GMs can use relationships as rewards. These relationships are measured by their Bond & Intensity. The Bond is the nature of the relationship between the characters, such as friendship, hatred, or romance. The Intensity is the measure of that relationship’s strength.

Relationship Bond
A character’s relationships can be simple & straightforward, or so complex they defy easy explanation. Both types have something to offer to a game, & so they are worth recording as Bonds. Bonds can exist between friends, bosses & employees, & even bitter rivals. Some characters may honor bonds between themselves & deceased loved ones, carrying on their legacy or resenting them for leaving the character too soon. It is important for both GMs & players to understand the foundation for the Bond between two characters & to track when it has grown & strengthened, or possibly atrophied & been replaced with something new. Here are some sample Bonds:
- **I Would Risk My Life For You**: This is a strong Bond that can act as a major driver of the character’s decision making. It may represent voluntary devotion built
on a romantic relationship, or a contract for bodyguard work.
- **I Won't Stop Until You're Dead**: This Bond represents a character’s burning desire to end another’s life. It is a strong Bond, not easily ignored or changed
through everyday action.
- **We've Gone Through Hell Together**: This Bond represents a character’s respect & devotion to a comrade in arms. This could be literal, in the case of the characters surviving a harrowing combat experience, or figurative, in the case of siblings surviving a horribly abusive childhood. Either way, strong bonds of trust & interdependence have been forged between them.
- **I Trust You To Be My Conscience**: The PC has created a dependency on another, trusting that person to make important decisions for them due to what they see as a deficiency in themselves. This Bond implies a certain level of devotion to the other person, though it can be easily exploited if the character relies too much upon it.
- **You're Someone I Love & Respect, But We Can Never Be Together The Way I Want**: This Bond represents a quiet yearning for something the character knows cannot be. It may be known or unknown to the subject of their desire, but the character likely doesn’t wish to acknowledge the gap between what they want & what they have, lest they lose even that.

Relationship Intensity
Relationship Intensity is measured with a rating of 1 to 5, with 1 being a new but significant relationship, & 5 being the kind of Bond characters experience only once in their lifetime.
For each rank of Intensity, a character gets a free stunt point they can use only for stunts involving or connected to the relationship. These SP can only be spent once per session, & only when the character’s actions are directly motivated by the relationship. Intensity stunt points can be used on any test, however, not just when the player rolls doubles. The Intensity SP can be combined with SP generated by rolling doubles. Intensity stunt points are available at the start of each game session, though GMs can rule that they refresh after a particularly cathartic interlude.

Adding Relationships
With the GM’s permission, characters may attempt to forge a new Bond with someone by spending an interlude performing the Relating activity, found in the Interlude Activities section in Chapter 5. This activity requires the characters to have an existing relationship on which to build. A new relationship should start at Intensity 1, though GMs may ask for a Communication(Expression/Seduction) test for particularly powerful Bonds to start at Intensity 2. New relationships shouldn’t start any higher, as such Intensity requires time to grow & deepen.

Changing Relationships
The nature of a Bond can change as a relationship changes over time. Intensity is not a static value, waxing & waning as characters grow closer or further apart in their daily lives. GMs & players should review a character’s relationships whenever they gain a level, to decide whether to change the type of Bonds they have, & the Intensity of each. Characters may also actively work to alter their existing Relationships by spending an interlude performing the Relating activity, as detailed in the Interlude Activities section in Chapter 5.
During this activity, the player & the GM should collaborate on how the relationship has changed.
GMs may require only a single interlude to slightly change the wording of a Bond, but may require more for a greater change. Changing Intensity is likewise up to the GM’s discretion, but a good benchmark is to require the character to spend a number of interludes performing the Relating activity equal to the level of Intensity they desire, either up or down one step. For example, a character with an Intensity 2 relationship would need to spend 3 interludes working on it to increase the Intensity to 3, but only a single interlude to reduce the Intensity to 1.

## Time-Keeping
Time in an Expanse game passes in two main ways: real time & game time. Real time is the actual passage of time while you play the game. If you & your friends sit down & play for four hours, then four hours of real time has passed, regardless of how much time has passed in the story for your characters. Real time is rarely referred to in the context of the game except in terms of a “session,” which is a real time period of playing The Expanse. A game session is expected to be between a couple of hours to four or five hours long. Game time is how much time passes in the context of the game’s narrative. It is also divided into two main types: narrative time & action time.

Narrative Time
Much of the story in an Expanse game passes in narrative time, which varies greatly depending on what the characters are doing & what the GM describes. For example, you might say your character visits a local bar on a station with friends for the evening. The GM picks things up by saying, “Several hours later...” so it is now several hours later in game time, even though it only took less than a minute of real time for you & the GM to describe it. Narrative time goes with the overall flow of the story; sometimes it is the same as real time, such as during an interaction encounter where everyone is playing out an entire conversation. Other times it compresses or glosses over segments of time, covering them with just a brief narrative, like “It takes a few minutes” or “About a week later.” The GM generally controls the flow of narrative time in the game.

Action Time
When things get tense & it starts to matter exactly who does what & in what order from moment to moment, narrative time ends & action time begins. Action time is most commonly used to handle fights, but it has other uses as well. Anything that would be considered an action scene in a movie can be handled with action time. Indeed, its primary use in The Expanse RPG is to handle action encounters (see Encounters, following). The GM usually signals the beginning of action time by telling the players to make an initiative test to determine who goes first & in what order. See Chapter 5 for details.
While narrative time is loose & flexible, action time is more tightly defined. Once it begins, the GM tracks time in short increments called rounds. During each round, every character in the encounter gets an opportunity to act, called their turn, in the order of initiative. Once everyone has taken a turn, that round ends & a new one begins. Things keep going, round after round, until the encounter is over & the game returns to narrative time.

Encounters
The narrative of an Expanse game is divided into encounters & interludes. These can be thought of like chapters in a novel, with each focused on a particular situation or scene. Encounters engage the characters with various situations, while interludes tend to be downtime for characters to use as they want. Encounters are more GM-driven, while interludes tend to be more player-driven. Encounters are further divided into three types:
- **Action Encounters**: Action encounters are the action scenes pitting the characters against various dangers, including fighting enemies, fleeing pursuit, or overcoming hazards.
- **Exploration Encounters**: Exploration encounters are about exploring & gathering information & generally interacting with the environment. They include investigations & research.
- **Social Encounters**: Social encounters are for conversation & personal interaction, whether tense negotiations, clever intrigues, or honest sharing of information & goals.

Each type of encounter has different objectives & good adventure design tends to mix & vary the types of encounters characters have during the course of an Expanse adventure (see Chapter 12: GMing, particularly Creating Adventures). Some encounters even mix types, such as an exploration-social with potential for exploring the environment & interacting with characters in it, or social-action, where a tense negotiation has the potential to turn into a fight or a chase.
Action encounters naturally occur during action time & social encounters usually occur during narrative time. Exploration encounters can go either way, depending on what the characters are doing and the difficulties they face; narrative time for general exploration, action time for dealing with sudden hazards & the like. Chapter 5 covers the 3 types of encounters & how they work in detail.

Interludes
Interludes come between various encounters in an Expanse game, although there isn’t always an interlude between every encounter. An interlude is a break in the narrative, a bit of downtime where the characters can do things they want or need to do, ranging from resting & recovering to studying, working, or otherwise pursuing their own goals. The most common times for interludes in The Expanse are transit times: the hours, days, or even weeks or longer it can take a ship to travel the vast distances between destinations in the System. There’s not much point in playing out an hour-by-hour accounting of such a trip, so it is usually summed up as an interlude until something interesting happens, including the ship arriving at its destination. The other common sort of interlude occurs when the characters have time off, such as visiting a station or other port of call, or having a duty rotation, shore leave, or such.
Interludes are when characters perform needed maintenance & upkeep for their equipment, ships, & incomes. Interludes can be opportunities for characters to bond & get to know one another better, which is common on long, confined trips. Conversely, an interlude can also be an opportunity for a group of characters to split up, each going off to do their own things, perhaps for a considerable amount of time before they come back together again. You can find details on interludes and how they play out in the game in Chapter 5.

## Reputation
Rewards don’t always need to be in the form of Income or levels. Characters earn renown & reputation through great deeds (or at least the rumor of them). Whether they’re called the “Butcher of Anderson Station” after a brutal military assault, or just known as the best private eye in the Belt, characters can leverage their reputation to smooth social interactions or get access to things out of the reach of other people.
This can make the difference between being treated as a suspicious outsider or a trusted ally, based on name alone. 
Reputation may be tied to a character’s specialization or talents. A hotshot racing pilot’s reputation for resisting high-gravity maneuvers speaks to her innate toughness, while a glory-hungry political firebrand’s reputation for rousing speeches speaks to his skill at reading & molding crowds of supporters. These reputations arise from the characters’ actions in play, & usually grant some kind of mechanical benefit when they engage in their area of expertise.
It’s important to remember that reputations are rarely permanent, especially when they run up against conflicting evidence. When the racing pilot loses a widely watched race, or the political firebrand makes an embarrassing gaffe during a live broadcast, their reputations can fade or change entirely. Characters who face this shift in fortunes may not have an easy time reclaiming former titles.
It is also notable that reputations do not need to be entirely deserved, or even true. Some characters pick up unearned reputations, or manage to fool people into thinking they are something they are not. Others carry the burden of others’ opinions or even accusations, which can prove difficult to shake.
Interludes offer characters the opportunity to grow or change their reputations, as detailed in the Interlude Activities section in Chapter 5. Characters who choose the Reputation activity during an interlude may work to bolster or diminish a current or nascent honorific. The GM decides when the character has done enough to gain or lose a specific reputation, but anything short of System-wide notoriety shouldn’t take more than a few interludes to influence.

Honorifics
Reputation is often represented in the titles a character carries. These honorifics are potent, but entirely situational. A champion athlete can’t usually count on their notoriety on the field to help sway people to their side in a tense political debate, for example, unless the policy being discussed somehow relates to their sport. The GM has the final say over whether an honorific provides its mechanical benefits within any given situation, though creative applications should always be encouraged and rewarded.

Personal Reputation
Characters can invoke their reputation to gain an advantage in a conflict. When they tell someone of their honorific, or impart the story of how they gained it, they gain a psychological edge. Spend 1 Fate point in an opposed test involving the character’s famed skill or natural ability for opponents to suffer -DisAdv to their opposing roll as they 2nd-guess their actions while up against a known expert.

Supportive Reputation
Characters also benefit mechanically when others invoke their honorific in support of their actions. This use of reputation requires someone other than the character to talk up their title or tell convincing stories of the deeds required to earn, by spending a Fate point. During the scene this occurs in, the character with the reputation being supported gains +Adv to any roll in which they demonstrate the abilities they’re known for.

Inspired Reputation
A character using their honorific outside of their field of interest or expertise is calling on it for an inspired purpose. Examples include a Bane telling stories of their assaults to win the trust of a group of mercenaries, or a famously loyal bodyguard invoking numerous injuries they received in the line of duty to convince a reluctant doctor to trust them during a tense triage. Spend 1 Fate point, granting +Adv on rolls to achieve an aim in which they demonstrate smart use of honorifics.

Passive Reputation
Characters generally make passive use of their honorifics more often than active use. When dealing with a group or individual aware of a character’s reputation & likely to be affected by it directly, GMs should color the interaction appropriately. In social situations where their identity is known, NPCs automatically shift their attitude 1 step suited to their reputation. This step isn’t always positive, as some people will dislike or mistrust a given honorific.

Sample Honorifics
Honorifics are simple titles or nicknames characters can earn for many reasons. Sample honorifics are provided here, along with alternative options for similar reputations. GMs & players may also devise their own honorifics based on the events of a campaign.

Absolute
The character is a paragon of a particular sub-culture or cause, & this honorific is a somewhat tongue-in-cheek acknowledgement. The character embodies their group’s preferred traits & is beloved by friends & contemporaries as a champion of their cause. Those opposing that cause or group also accept the character as its champion. They attack the character relentlessly & look for any betrayal of their stated traits to publicly reveal them as a hypocrite.

Bane
The character’s relentless bounty hunting earns them a reputation as someone who enforces the law in a lawless region. They may ruthlessly pursue their quarry, or maybe they simply keep an ear to the ground; regardless, they've earned the gratitude of those who prioritize security, & the wrath of their targets.

Champion/Star
The character is a star fighter, having won notable renown through rough fights or smart strategy. They’re known through reputation in fighting circles, as well as potentially across their region or settlement. This makes the character both an admired figure & a target for jealous rivals to unseat. Until that happens, they receive recognition for their prowess.

Expert/Doyen
Characters who dedicate themselves to a single professional pursuit or area of study can become recognized for their knowledge & achievements. Such a professional reputation doesn’t always translate to name recognition with the general public, but no one who sees them work can doubt their competence. Of course, this expertise can be recognized by rivals in their field who still disagree with their results & want to discredit them.

Loyal/Blood-Brother
The character has a reputation for sticking to their friends no matter what, even when doing so is clearly a bad idea. This reputation can also be earned for dogged service, but only if the character goes above & beyond what’s expected of them, taking a metaphorical (or maybe literal) bullet for their employer. Many people respect such loyalty & seek to reward it, but others see it as a trait to be exploited & taken advantage of.

Lucky/Blessed/Chosen
Things always seem to work out for this character. They may not rise to the pinnacle of greatness like some, but things always seem to turn out well for them, even in the face of overwhelming odds. A lucky character escapes criminal charges due to technicalities, or goes on to win the whole pot after betting their last credits in a card game. Such constant winning breeds resentment, & many people who lose to such a character may go out of their way to bring them low.

Hero/Butcher
The character is known for defending those who cannot defend themselves. Whether it was one small group, a whole town, or an entire station, they are praised for their bravery & righteousness by everyone who has heard of their actions. Due to their fame, characters with this honorific have access to important people in the government & media, but fame can be a two-edged sword. Certain elements of the public are always waiting to bring their heroes low, & whomever it was the character thwarted to gain the reputation is likely to seek revenge.

Generous/Libertine
A character known as generous can have a reputation for romantic prowess, certainly, but could also be known for their compassion & generosity. Such characters can wave their reputation like a banner to attract people to them, or wield it more subtly to get just what they want. People can become jealous of such rivals, though, & go to great lengths to discredit them when they feel upstaged or ignored.

Survivor/Jinxed
The character has faced a litany of disasters & tragedies, but come through the experience unscathed -- or at least alive. It seems no matter what odds they face, whether they ultimately succeed or fail, they’ll still find a way through to face the next challenge. Stories of their tenacity tend to impress others & earn their respect, but some will view the character’s reputation as a challenge to be overcome, or blame them for the deaths of others who weren't so lucky.

Visionary/Genius/Hack
A character honored as a visionary has earned fame in a particular medium through great skill or clever marketing. They likely have the attention of wealthy patrons, as well as legions of up-and-comers who want to follow the path they blazed. That said, critics are always eager to proclaim a misstep or lament a descent into comfortable mediocrity. Up-and-comers are also likely to see an established visionary as the tired status quo they need to rebel against.

Membership
Characters can obtain membership in organizations based on their backgrounds or professions, but their influence within those organizations depends upon their rank. GMs can decide a character’s rank based on their accomplishments on behalf of the organization, as well as the length of their tenure & the strength of their reputation. For example, a miner’s union will recognize a character’s length of time on the job & their work ethic, but they’re unlikely to support that character representing the union in political circles if they’re gruff & have few friends in the union.
Organizations have great diversity in their structures & reasons for existing. Many seek greater social control for their members, but one may try to achieve this through strict regimentation & collaboration while another is a loose conglomeration of people with similar political philosophies. Such organizations can likewise differ greatly in scope. One may wield sway over a single profession throughout the System but be completely unknown by everyone else, while a local political group may have name recognition in the media but only wield power in a small area.
Characters move through the ranks of organizations only after the GM has awarded them a rank increase & they spend an interlude performing the Advancement activity, as detailed in the Interlude Activities section in Chapter 5.

Rank 1: Recruit
Characters newly inducted into an organization’s ranks receive a +1 bonus to all rolls related to positive dealings within the ranks. This bonus builds upon any prior good relations with the group, rising to a total +2 bonus for such characters. New recruits are often kept at arm’s length for a while. They are tested & evaluated -- sometimes openly, sometimes covertly -- before being trusted with greater access to the organization & its inner workings. They rarely know anyone beyond their fellow recruits & immediate superiors. Even at this level, membership brings perks. Characters may access the group’s basic resources, including things like provided services, shared credit accounts, or company housing. Political groups may offer access to related people in positions of power, while professional groups may provide certain services at a discount or even for free. Security & military organizations provide many of their members’ needs, as well as granting them access to equipment & weapons not readily available to civilians. It’s understood that new recruits often have an outsized sense of their role in an organization. That’s why groups limit the support of their new members, thereby limiting the degree to which the organization’s resources can be expended just to brag in a bar. New members are expected to prove themselves & earn greater trust. Should they fail to live up to expectations, many organizations won’t hesitate to sever ties.

Rank 2: Respected
After passing through the trials of their early tenure & gaining the respect of their superiors, characters can rise to the rank of respected member of an organization. Organizations differ greatly in terms of which traits they prize in members, but most make clear what actions characters should undertake to get ahead. When they have finally reached this level, characters gain a +2 bonus to any tests involving other members of their organization at their rank or lower. Respected members also gain a +1 bonus in social interactions with non-members who have reason to respect or fear the organization. At this rank, characters gain access to their group’s full organizational resources, usually including other personnel. They may command subordinates to perform easy encounters on their behalf, or use organization resources to pay recruits to handle encounters of average difficulty. These members are not totally subservient (unless they’re members of a cult, or something similar). They work for the respected member in order to gain recognition within the organization, as well as the pay. Finally, full members have access to all of their group’s resources, within reason. This includes wealth & equipment, as well as information & access to high-ranking people with connections to the organization. At this rank, most groups expect characters to act in the group’s best interests, & not to waste resources on their own goals. Should a character abuse these resources, the leaders of the group may step in.

Rank 3: Leader
The true height of power within an organization, Rank 3 can be difficult to reach unless a character started the group themselves. Members of this rank wield tremendous power over other members of the organization, setting policy & controlling access to the group’s resources & personnel. There is no mechanical bonus granted to characters with this level of control; instead, they have full control over the group’s priorities & actions. GMs should keep in mind that this control doesn’t extend to what members think about the group, only what they must do in order to remain loyal. Characters in a position of authority over a group do gain a +1 bonus in social situations where their control of the group would impress nonmembers, in addition to the social bonus from Rank 2, for a total of +2. Authority figures who focus their organization’s resources only on their own personal interests or vendettas may find the group’s power or influence begins to slip. They may face greater opposition from allies or other members of the group who disagree with its new direction. Should the character continue their selfish course, they could face a full-blown internal coup.

## Exploration Encounters
Exploration encounters don't necessarily put the characters' lives in danger and because they happen mostly in narrative time, they don't require as many detailed rules as combat. Much of the time, exploration encounters can be resolved through roleplaying or describing the situation, or using advanced tests.
Exploration encounters involve exploring or searching an area, investigating a mystery, making or modifying machines and other objects, and doing pretty much anything where the focus is on places, objects, and information instead of action or social exchanges. But there’s no strict division between encounter types, so exploration encounters flow into action encounters, and are punctuated with social situations.

Hazards
Opponents aren’t the only threats the characters face. They might contend with fire, vacuum, sudden falls and impacts, mechanical failures, and other perils. All these come under the general header of “hazards.”
The AGE System handles hazards with a general system for simulating everything from explosions to drowning. Adventures define specific hazards, but when you need to adjudicate them on your own, answer the following questions:

Hazard Category | Dmg | Example
----------------|-----|-
Minor           | 1d6 | floor littered with glass & debris
Moderate        | 2d6 | high-g exposure
Major           | 3d6 | exploding panel
Arduous         | 4d6 | shuttle crash
Harrowing       | 5d6 | radiation poisoning
Murderous       | 6d6 | vacuum exposure

What is the Nature of the Hazard?
Describe the nature of the hazard in a general way. It could be a treacherous path leading up the side of a mountain, a raging fire, or a tripwire that sets off an explosive. Define the broad parameters.

Can it be Avoided?
Some hazards, particularly traps, are hidden dangers. These might be detected with a Perception test, using a focus appropriate for the hazard. Use Seeing to notice a patch of disturbed earth over a buried landmine, for example. If there is a chance of detection, set the TN for the ability test as usual. PCs who make a successful test can avoid the hazard, or at least get a clue that may help them do so. Those that fail walk right into it.

How Dangerous is the Hazard?
Just as you assess difficulty for ability tests, so too must you assess the danger of hazards. Consult the Hazard Category table and pick the one that best suits the nature of the hazard. This determines the base damage the hazard inflicts. You might decide, for example, that falling from a height is a major hazard, so that would inflict 3d6 damage. Only rare, dangerous hazards inflict more than 6d6 damage.
You can also allow an ability test to mitigate the hazard’s damage. A good guideline is that a successful test means the character suffers only half damage (rounded down). The falling character, for example, could be given a chance to make a TN 15 Dexterity (Acrobatics) test to halve the damage.
Also decide if the hazard’s damage is penetrating or if Toughness protects against it, as usual, and the condition applied if a character is taken out by the hazard (see Taken Out under Action Encounters, previously). For deadly hazards, this is usually dying, but others may simply leave characters unconscious or helpless instead.

Does it Have any Special Conditions or Effects?
Some hazards impose a temporary condition. Examples might include such things as smoke from a fire leaving characters blinded, or a blast leaving them deafened, an impact knocking characters prone, or special effects like reducing a character’s Speed, imposing a penalty for certain tests. The GM decides if any such effects are part of the hazard, and whether or not an ability test can mitigate them, much like reducing the hazard’s damage (previously). See Conditions in Chapter 1 for options.

How Long Does it Last?
Many hazards happen once and then end. An explosive trap, for example, explodes once when triggered. Other hazards can be ongoing. Characters running through a burning building suffer damage each round until they escape, and characters exposed to radiation or vacuum likewise suffer damage every round. Use common sense as your guide to determine whether the hazard is a single incident or reoccurring and, if so, how often it reoccurs.

For specific examples of hazards and how they are handled, see Chapter 13: Threats.

## Investigations
Information is power and, in The Expanse, finding information can be a major focus of an adventure. Note that some investigations have social components, and may mix with a social encounter (see Social Encounters, following).

Simple Investigations
Some investigation encounters are simple. Succeed on an ability test against a TN set by the GM, and you get the information you need. You just need to be in the right place at the right time. In some cases, a roll isn’t even required. The information is either obvious once you get there, or the GM assumes your character has the interest and ability to find it. The GM may also ask for a specific focus that represents the required knowledge or intuition to notice the information.

Detailed Investigations
Some investigations must be carried out across multiple steps, forming an investigative trail. Each step on the trail is a lead, and discovering the significance of a lead unearths a clue and a new lead. Discovering all of the clues produces a reveal: the ultimate truth the clues uncover.
A trail doesn’t need to be linear. It can have many branches, but in most cases following any branch to the end produces the same reveal. The GM should avoid putting dead ends in an investigation, unless an enemy blocks the trail deliberately, or as a momentary setback that can be reversed by creative heroes.
The GM doesn’t need to pre-plan the trail—they can improvise depending on what the heroes do. Instead, the GM creates several leads whose clues connect them. The GM must determine the following things for each lead.

SITUATION
What brings the characters to the lead, and what is the lead in the story? A discarded piece of clothing could be a lead,
as could an anonymous email that, at first glance, seems to be full of nothing but digital gibberish. A combat encounter
could also constitute a lead.

UNLOCKING METHOD
What events or actions unveils the clue and points toward the next lead? The following options are available.
- AUTOMATIC Just showing up, finding the object, or otherwise doing whatever is necessary brings forth the clue. The GM can tell you when you need to know based on your character’s prior knowledge or common sense. An NPC might be willing to spill the beans.
- HAVING THE FOCUS Like the automatic method, no roll is needed, but the character examining the lead must have one or more specific focuses. Noticing a gunman never intended to hit his target might be automatic for anyone examining bullet holes or a video of the firefight, as long as they possess any gun-related Accuracy focus. A character with the Intelligence (Art) focus might notice an obvious forgery, and so forth.
- ABILITY TEST Most commonly, unlocking a lead requires a character to succeed at an ability test. This is often an Intelligence, Communication, or Perception test, but any ability might be useful depending on the circumstances. For instance, a Fighting test might reveal that an enemy studied at a particular martial arts school. The GM determines the most useful, or primary focuses, and any tangential, or less useful focuses, along with the TN of the test. See Investigation Focuses for more details.

CLUE AND NEXT LEAD
Determine the payoff: the clue and next lead. The clue is simply information. The GM tells you what the unlocked lead means. The GM should not just provide information based on the lead itself, but add whatever the character’s previous knowledge and common sense would bring forth. The resolved lead points toward a new lead, until you’ve uncovered enough clues for the full reveal.

Investigation Focuses
The GM decides which, if any, focuses are helpful or required to unlock a lead. A focus best suited to unlock a lead is the primary focus. If an ability test is required, roll the dice and apply the focus as usual.
Some focuses are useful, but less than ideal. These are tangential focuses. For instance, you might not have Intelligence (Demolitions), the primary focus to examine a detonator, but you might ask the GM if your Intelligence (Technology) might help. The GM decides it’s a tangential focus and reveals less information, or information more suited to the focus in question. If an ability test is required, the TN increases by +2 for a test with a tangential focus.
If you don’t have a primary or tangential focus, the GM decides whether you can make a test to unlock the lead at all, especially for tests with a required focus (see Chapter 3: Character Traits).
The GM doesn’t need to decide on primary and tangential focuses ahead of time, and can define them after talking to the players. If you present a good enough argument, an unlikely focus might become a tangential focus, or even a primary one!

The Reveal
Once the GM decides you’ve unlocked enough leads and deciphered enough clues along the trail, they provide the reveal: the final truth about the subjects being investigated. The GM can simply inform you, or provide it through an NPC, discovered documents, and other elements of the story. Again, the GM draws on your prior knowledge and common sense. The reveal’s facts should be either scattered throughout the clues you’ve discovered, or the clues should bring you somewhere where it all comes to light.
The GM doesn’t always have to provide a moment for the reveal. You may discover it with the facts at hand. If the GM thinks it would be useful, they can inform you that you’ve figured everything out, and perhaps grant additional rewards to recognize your cleverness.

## Social Encounters
Social encounters involve interactions between people, and often combine with exploration or action encounters, as well as fitting in between them. An investigation might require interviews, and combat can stop or start at the utterance of a single, critical word.
The GM may choose to run social encounters as a pure roleplaying exercise, without any rules. The GM plays the part of any NPCs, while you speak as your character, or tell the GM the sorts of things you’d like your hero to say. The rules in this section aren’t meant to get in the way of roleplaying, but to provide inspiration for social scenes, align improvised dialogue with the goals of the story, and streamline interactions that might be awkward or dull otherwise.
Morale rules, covering an NPC’s willingness to fight, are covered in Chapter 12: Game Mastering.

3d6   | Attitudes     | Interaction Mod
------|---------------|-
3-    | Very Hostile  | -3
4-5   | Hostile       | -2
6-8   | Standoffish   | -1
9-11  | Neutral       | +0
12-14 | Open          | +1
15-17 | Friendly      | +2
18+   | Very Friendly | +3

Impressions and Attitudes
First impressions matter. The GM decides how an NPC feels about you based on that character’s motives and emotions.
In other words, the GM sets the NPC’s attitude. The GM doesn’t need to use any rules, but might find it useful to select an attitude from the Attitudes table, or roll 3d6, adding the following modifiers:
- COMMUNICATION Add the Communication ability score of the character taking the lead in making contact. If a Communication focus would apply to the first impression, add its bonus as well.
- REPUTATION Add +2 for a Reputation that would impress the NPC. Impose -2 for a Reputation that would offend the NPC. See the Rewards chapter for more about Reputation.
- OTHER MODIFIERS The GM can add other modifiers to the roll based on the NPC’s known feelings and motives.

One overriding rule is that NPCs will never defy their most deeply held values or sacrifice their personal safety without an exceptional circumstance coming into play. Violent threats using Strength (Intimidation) are one way to sway an unwilling NPC. Blackmail, lies, and other methods may work as well, but the NPC may resent you for this, with potential consequences in the future.
- VERY HOSTILE The very hostile NPC can barely contain their dislike, and is inclined to respond to contact with either violence or by leaving the characters’ presence. They may nurse a grudge and oppose the characters in the future. This is a rare spontaneous impression, and the GM should come up with a specific reason why any first impression would get a Very Hostile response.
- HOSTILE The hostile NPC reacts to contact with ire, but might disguise this. They either refuse to provide help, or undermine the characters’ apparent interests.
- STANDOFFISH The standoffish NPC would prefer that the characters just leave them alone. They either avoid the characters, ignore them, or firmly ask interlopers to go away.
- NEUTRAL The neutral NPC hasn’t decided things either way about characters making contact, and responds with cool caution, bored disinterest, or polite detachment, depending on their personality.
- OPEN The open NPC is curious or inclined to listen to the characters, and reacts appropriately based on their own motives and interests. Things could go either way. A negative variation of Open is Cowed, where the NPC is a bit afraid of what the characters might do if they don’t act receptive. Once the threat appears to be gone, the NPC becomes Standoffish.
- FRIENDLY The friendly NPC takes a shine to characters making contact and is inclined to help them, but hesitates to provide any assistance that could cause them problems. A negative variation of Friendly is Shaken, where the NPC provides assistance out of fear. Once the threat appears to be gone, the NPC becomes Hostile.
- VERY FRIENDLY The very friendly NPC is exceptionally welcoming, and provides gestures of respect or hospitality without being prompted. The NPC may provide extraordinary help, though nothing that contradicts their values. This is a rare spontaneous impression, and the GM should come up with a specific reason why any first impression would get a Very Friendly response. A negative variation of Very Friendly is Terrified, where the NPC anxiously does anything possible to avoid a perceived (or very real) threat. Once the threat is gone and the NPC feels safe, their attitude shifts to Very Hostile.

Detailed Social Interactions
Sometimes you want to flex your social muscles, or get involved in deep intrigue. This is where detailed social interaction comes in. In these rules, the goal is to change an NPC’s attitude to one where they feel inclined to do something in your favor. This may involve significant effort, so this system is better applied to major favors or changes in a relationship with the NPC. Again, some NPCs may never act in certain ways, as it contradicts their strongest beliefs.
The effort involved to achieve such significant influence is measured in shifts. A shift represents a change in attitude, opinion, object of attention, or any other social hurdle you must overcome.

Social Rules for Player Characters
The rules in this section are normally only used to sway NPCs, but you can use them with other players to guide your roleplaying. In this case, the rules serve as advice, telling you what you might do, not what you must do. You select your own starting attitude.
If you change your attitude and put yourself at a disadvantage because the rules suggest your character would be swayed by social maneuvering, the GM may reward you in some fashion, including restoring Fortune or an award of Reputation, Relationship, or Membership rank.

SOCIAL “COMBAT”
The GM decides the NPC’s current attitude, and the attitude required to comply with your wishes. Note the number of shifts required to move along the scale from the current attitude to the target attitude. For instance, moving from Standoffish, to Neutral, to Open, to Friendly is 3 shifts. Add 1 shift to focus the NPC’s attention toward doing what you wish. Furthermore, the GM can add 1 or 2 shifts to represent the NPC’s greater resistance to your efforts if the desired actions would inconvenience or trouble them in some way.
The final number of shifts can be achieved in two ways: through social maneuvers, or in a grand gesture.

SOCIAL MANEUVERS
Each shift becomes an action you perform to adjust the NPC’s attitude. You can suggest an action, or the GM can require one. These may be opposed tests with the NPC or specific tasks for you to complete, such as giving the NPC a gift or laying low one of their rivals. These tasks clear any additional shifts that represent resistance first. Subsequent shifts improve the NPC’s attitude, and your last task directs them to your goal. Utterly blowing a task may set back progress by one or more shifts at the GM’s discretion, but in many cases nothing may happen, though any change in attitude can linger, providing a partial benefit. Thus, shifting attitudes is something that can happen between other encounters, as a gradual process.

THE GRAND GESTURE
Instead of performing many small tasks to clear shifts, the GM may allow you to perform a single ambitious gesture intended to influence the NPC in one fell swoop. The grand gesture is an advanced test representing any complex project that might win the NPC’s favor. A grand gesture test has a success threshold of 3-5 (determined by the GM) multiplied by the number of shifts, with interval times and other details set by the GM. If you complete the gesture in time, you produce the desired attitude and response, but if you fall short, you get nothing.

## Interludes
Whereas encounters are largely GM-driven, with the GM presenting players with a situation and then adjudicating their characters’ actions, interludes are largely player-driven. These are segments of downtime in between encounters in the narrative of the game. The most common interludes in The Expanse occur during long travel times between destinations in the system, or during off-ship breaks like shore-leave on a station or colony. An interlude allows characters time to pursue their own interests and goals, to recover from the exertions of their adventures, and to handle the routine tasks of life that get pushed aside in the press of encounters and action time. The process for handling interludes in play is as follows:
1. The GM informs the players of an interlude, such as, “Your trip to Ganymede is going to take about a week, so you have an interlude.” In some cases, the players can also request an interlude like, “When we dock at the station, we want to take some time for an interlude.” The GM decides when an interlude begins, however, since the players may not be aware of the circumstances, such as trouble awaiting them on the station with at least one (if not several!) encounters before they get a break.
2. The players declare how their characters will spend their time during the interlude. Depending on the length of time available, they may pursue one activity or several, depending on their requirements. The characters may cooperate on some goals or split up for others.
3. Players and the GM make any necessary tests for the characters’ declared activities to see how they progress or succeed, or not. Some interlude activities require no test so long as there is sufficient time, while others need a test to see if they are successful and, if so, to what degree.
4. Once all character activities during the interlude are resolved, the GM declares the end of the interlude and begins the next encounter. By definition, an encounter always follows an interlude; two or more interludes simply add up to a single, longer interlude with more options for activities.

Interludes Between Adventures
Generally, unless a game session ends on a cliffhanger in the middle of an encounter or leads directly into another encounter, it is common to insert an interlude between the end of one Expanse game session and the beginning of the next. The GM should decide whether to play out the interlude as the end of the session or the start of the next, as time and circumstances allow. You can even play out the interlude during the time between game sessions, with the players and the GM communicating via email or other means, so at the start of the next game, the interlude is already concluded and play jumps right into the next encounter.

Interludes and Fortune
Generally, during an interlude, characters recover expended Fortune points, returning to their usual starting total (see Fortune in Chapter 1 and Chapter 2). This reflects the opportunity for characters to regroup, gather their wits, and generally prepare themselves for whatever challenges await them next.
While Recovering, characters regain 10+ level Fortune every 8 hours. Additionally, a character can choose one favored activity where they regain Fortune at the same rate as Recovering: This might be Relating for a social character, Researching for a bookworm, and so forth. The character’s player chooses the activity, approved by the GM. Otherwise, characters regain 5 + level Fortune during an interlude.

Recovering or Favored Activity = 10+ Level Fortune per 8 hours

Other Activities = 5+ Level Fortune per Interlude

Interludes VS. Encounters
Some of the activities described for interludes also fit the parameters for exploration or social encounters. So how do you decide which is which? Generally speaking, interludes are relatively brief parts of the narrative, even if they last for long periods of game time. They can usually be summed up with just a sentence or paragraph, such as, “Over the next couple of weeks, you recover, and then set to work on rebuilding that damaged cargo bay hatch” or “During the week-long trip, you spend some time together outside of doing routine ship maintenance, getting to know one another better.” The stakes in interludes also tend to be lower. The characters aren’t under pressure and usually the worst consequence is not having enough time or the right requirements to complete an activity.
Encounters, on the other hand, tend to focus on the moment-by-moment aspects of things. Exploration and social encounters may not break time down as minutely as action encounters do, but they still tend to progress with a fair amount of attention to detail: who does and says what when to whom and so forth. That doesn’t mean you might not want to roleplay out parts of an interlude activity, especially Relating, or gloss over some of the details of a social encounter with an ability test, but keep in mind the differences between them.

Interlude Activities
Depending on the length of the interlude, characters can engage in one or more activities. These are similar to actions taken during action time, but on a more narrative time scale, and interlude activities are largely simultaneous, rather than handled in rounds like action time. This section describes the most common interlude activities but, like the Actions section of this chapter, players should feel free to come up with their own, with the GM adjudicating them using existing activities as guidelines.
In some cases, an interlude activity requires an advanced test, with the test total determining how long it takes the character to complete the activity (see Advanced Tests in Chapter 1). If the character does not complete the activity in the time of the interlude, it’s up to the GM whether or not those efforts carry forward to the next interlude, where the characters have the opportunity to pick up the activities where they left off. Generally, this should be the case, unless there’s a compelling reason why the initial time invested into the activity would be lost, such as changing conditions or time-sensitive work.

ADVANCEMENT
During the interlude, you spend time consolidating an advancement within an organization.
**Requires**: You must have received an advancement in Membership as a reward prior to the start of the interlude (see Membership in Chapter 14).
**Resolve**: This requires a test only if the GM feels it is needed to close the deal of an award of advancement in rank, in which case it should generally be an advanced test of Communication, unless the organization prizes some other ability you can use to demonstrate your worthiness. The test should have a fairly low success threshold, between 5 and 10, reflecting your already existing value to the organization.

MAINTENANCE
You make sure things are functioning properly.
**Requires**: You need the necessary tools, parts, and equipment. If you’re lacking them, or they are of poor quality, the GM may say your maintenance work takes longer or is less effective. If you need to acquire them, then an Income test is needed, with a Cost set by the GM using the guidelines in Chapters 3 and 4.
**Resolve**: Usually, no test is required, although the GM may require a character to have the appropriate focus, like Intelligence (Engineering or Technology) to do the work, and sufficient time and resources.

MAKING OR FIXING
You spend time making or fixing something.
**Requires**: You need the necessary materials (which can be acquired with an Income test with a TN equal to the item’s value –5) and necessary tools and equipment. If you are lacking in the latter, the GM may apply a penalty to the advanced test. If you are fixing rather than building something, subtract an additional 2 from the TN of the Income test.
**Resolve**: Make an advanced test using the appropriate focus, such as Dexterity (Crafting), Intelligence (Engineering), or Intelligence (Chemistry) with a TN equal to the item’s cost –2. The GM determines the success threshold based on the item’s complexity: 5 for a simple item; 10 to 15 for more complex ones; up to 20 to 25 for truly complex works or pieces of equipment. Lower the success threshold by as much as half for fixing something rather than building it from scratch, so a threshold of 20 might become 10, for example. The GM can adjust this based on the extent of the repairs needed. Each roll represents 6 hours of work. When you reach the threshold, the item is complete.

RECOVERING
Sometimes, you need to spend an interlude, perhaps even several, recovering from the results of your prior encounters.
**Requires**: While recovering, the character needs to engage in only light activity: resting, reading, conversation, and so forth. No other activities can be undertaken during the same interlude while recovering.
**Resolve**: Make an advanced TN 11 Constitution (Stamina) test every 24 hours. If you are under medical care, your physician (or auto-doc) can make an Intelligence (Medicine) test against the same TN and you can use the better of the two rolls. Track the result of the Drama Die for each successful test. At a success threshold of 5, you can remove an injured condition. At a success threshold of 15, you can remove a wounded condition. For recovering from additional conditions due to hazards, the GM sets the necessary success threshold. If recovery conditions are less than ideal—like trying to recover in the wilderness with little shelter or food, or on a ship low on supplies with minimal life support—the GM may increase the TN of the test.

RELATING
You take time to get to know someone better, or to change the nature of your relationship.
**Requires**: Relating only requires time and someone willing to relate to you, or given no choice but to do so by circumstances. At the GM’s discretion, you might need to at least get someone else to an attitude of Neutral toward you in a social encounter before you can really relate to them during an interlude.
**Resolve**: No test is required (except perhaps to improve the other person’s initial attitude, see Requirements). You just take time to either change your relationship with someone (see Changing Relationships in Chapter 14) or to establish or strengthen a Bond (see Adding Relationships in Chapter 14). The GM determines how long this takes: It might be anywhere from a heartfelt conversation for an hour or two to spending days or even longer together.

REPUTATION
You live up to your reputation, or create a new one for yourself.
**Requires**: Either an existing reputation to maintain or a new one you are aiming for. See Reputation in Chapter 14 for details.
**Resolve**: You spend time doing things in accordance with your reputation in order to maintain it; reputations and fame can be fleeting, and a known pattern of behavior can reinforce them. Exactly what depends on your reputation, but during an interlude it is often making your actions known in some way, whether it is giving an interview or broadcasting a video or a piece of writing out to the system. In some cases, the GM may require a test, such as Communication (Expression or Performing) to measure the effectiveness of your efforts. You can likewise do things counter to a current reputation in order to try and rid yourself of it, or something new in order to gain a new reputation. The GM decides when it is appropriate to drop an old reputation or to award you a new one, as given in Chapter 14.

RESEARCHING
You spend time looking up (or digging for) information.
**Requires**: You need access to sources of information, usually your hand terminal and a network, although some research might also require specific sources of data or even subjects of study, such as biological or material samples.
**Resolve**: Make an advanced Intelligence (Research) test with a TN based on how obscure or difficult to find the information you’re looking for is. Each test represents 4 hours of work. The GM sets the success threshold for when you find what you’re looking for. Optionally, the GM can set multiple thresholds, each revealing a particular piece of information about the subject, until you have found out everything there is to know about it.

TRAINING
Practice makes perfect, or at least secures progress.
**Requires**: You need the time and the right conditions to train with whatever focus or talent you’re practicing. This may also call for certain equipment, at the GM’s discretion, such as a shooting range (or at least a virtual simulator) to train with guns, for example.
**Resolve**: No test is needed, but you need a hundred hours of training (cumulative) to acquire a new focus or new degree in a talent, or to advance an ability after gaining a level (see Advancement in Chapter 1). The GM is free to reduce or even waive this time as best suits the overall story. Otherwise, interludes after characters gain a level can be assumed to be taken up with at least some training time.

UPKEEP
You put time and Income into maintaining a lifestyle.
**Requires**: The necessary Income.
**Resolve**: No test is required, unless the characters is trying to live above their means and enjoy a higher lifestyle than their Income would normally allow. In that case, reduce the character’s Income by 1 per additional class of lifestyle, just like overextending Income on a purchase. Naturally, this makes this sort of living quite unsustainable.

WORKING
A prime way to handle upkeep is by working to get paid.
**Requires**: A paying job the character can perform.
**Resolve**: Characters can spend interludes working a job, either for a particular employer or a freelance or gig approach of getting paid for certain tasks. The default is that the character maintains their Income score, and may recover from any reduction in Income from expenses prior to the interlude, at the GM’s discretion. Alternately, the character can take a riskier approach, making a test with a suitable focus for the work against TN 13. If successful, the character scores a temporary windfall, a +1 to Income that lasts until after the next purchase requiring an Income test. However, if the test fails, the character suffers a reversal: a –1 penalty to Income that lasts until the character’s next opportunity to increase or restore Income by reward, leveling, or interlude.

Interlude Priorities
Game Masters should emphasize the necessity of Maintenance, Upkeep, and Working during interludes, if the crew intends to maintain all of their equipment, technology, and their general Income and lifestyle (see Income in Chapter 3 and Lifestyle in Chapter 4). If these key activities are neglected, the GM should feel free to do things like lower the characters’ Income scores, apply Flaws to their equipment (or their ship!), have creditors come after them, impose trouble with finding (or leaving) a berth at a space-dock, and so forth until they take the necessary interludes to make up for lost time and effort.
Sometimes this requires characters to juggle their priorities, especially when they would rather be pursuing some other activity (like Relating or Advancement) when they need to partake in an activity like Recovering. Fulfilling their needed interludes is a useful story hook as well; when the crew needs Income, time off, supplies, or a safe harbor, it gets them thinking and planning about their next moves.
