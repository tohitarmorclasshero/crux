# Heritage-Human

## Humans
- **Languages**: You can speak the common trade tongue, plus the language of your home region.
- **Special Origin**: Choose 1 of the following regions as your place of origin: 

#### Black Wave Riders
Region: Ghost Sea
- Sure-Footed. Difficult terrain doesn't cost you extra movement when you use the Dash action.
- Windwright's Intuition: Add +1d4 to all Acrobatics or Navigator's tools checks.

#### Blue River Boaters
Region: Jade Hell, Spear Coast
- Intuitive Motion: Add +1d4 to all Acrobatics & Pilot checks.

#### Green Jade Runners
Region: Jade Hell
- **Forest Intuition**: Add +1d4 to all Survival & Athletics checks.
- **Forest-walk**: Checks made to track you are at -DisAdv & you can move through difficult terrain made of non-magical plants & overgrowth without spending extra movement.
- **Weathered**: You're naturally adapted to cold & hot climates (DMG, chapter 5)
- **Fast Agility**: When you move on your turn, you can double your speed until the end of the turn. Once you do this you can't again until you move 0 feet on one of your turns.

#### Gleamer
Region: Zirtan
Whether safe behind the walls of the High City or out in the wastes with little more than tent flaps, shattered ruins, & grim determination to stand against the horrors of the night, urbanites are the most well-rounded people of Zenith. While the dragon-glass city of Zirtan stands majestic and imposing over the landscape, most urbanite humans are relegated to live outside the city gates in the refugee town officially called Gleam. No one who lives there calls it that, they call it Lucre. Gleamers are those trying to move upward socially, and looked down on by their neighbors as sycophants and traitors.
- **Ability Score Increase**: Increase all ability scores +1.
- **Cunning Intuition**: Add +1d4 to all Stealth & Persuade checks.

#### Ogre
Requires: Str15+, Int9-, Cha9-
- **Cursed**: You're a mutant human. You're immune to certain curses that affect your physical form.
- **Aggressive**: As a bonus action, you can move up to your speed toward an enemy of your choice that you can see or hear. You must end this move closer to the enemy than you started.

#### Tiefling
Requires: Con13+, Cha9-
- **Cursed**: You're a mutant human. You're immune to certain curses that affect your physical form.
- **Dragonmark**: You know 1 cantrip of your choice from any spell list. When you reach 3rd level, you can cast a 1st-level spell of your choice from any spell list once with this trait & regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest. When you reach 5th level, you can cast a 2nd-level spell of your choice from any spell list once with this trait & regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for these spells.
