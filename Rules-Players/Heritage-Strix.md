# Heritage-Strix

## Strix
Requires: Dex13+, Str9-
* **Flight**: Thanks to your wings, you have a fly speed equal to your walking speed. You can't use this fly speed if you're wearing any armor.
* **Bird Bones**: You count as one size smaller when determining your carrying capacity & the weight you can push, drag, or lift.
* **Armless**: Your arms are wings, you have no hands, but your feet are just as dextrous as hands, & you can use them as hands with no problem. Remember to always keep 1 unoccupied or you'll fall over.
* **Dexterous Feet**: You can take the Use Object action as a bonus action.
* **Silent Feathers**: Add +1d4 to stealth checks when flying.
* **Hawkeyed**: You have proficiency in Perception. In addition, attacking at long range doesnâ€™t impose -DisAdv on your ranged weapon attacks.
* **Mimicry**: You can mimic sounds you have heard, including voices. A creature that hears the sounds you make can tell they are imitations with a successful Insight check against DC 8+(Cha mod+ProfBonus).
