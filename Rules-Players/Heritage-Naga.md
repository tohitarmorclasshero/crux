# Heritage-Naga

## Naga
- **Venomous**: You may choose to do poison damage with your natural attacks.
- **Stealthy**: +Adv on stealth checks.
- **Hold Breath**: You can hold your breath for up to 15 minutes at a time.
- **Mask of the Wild**: You can attempt to hide even when you are only lightly obscured by foliage, heavy rain, falling snow, mist, & other natural phenomena.

#### Brute-subrace
You are 12-17 feet long, 900-1200 pounds, and 3-6 feet tall crocodile. This might be a problem in some situations, and it is worthy of note. You also have claws which aren't built for manipulating objects, though your jaw/tongue can function as a very clumsy hand if need be.
Requires: Str15+, Cha9-
- **Hunter's Lore**: Gain proficiency in 2 of these skills of your choice: Nature, Perception, Stealth, & Survival.
- **Armor Proficiency**: Crocodiles of MR-KR-GR have a natural armor equivalent to hides and leathers, which at level 5 becomes equivalent to chainmail, and at level 10 becomes equivalent to plate. Crocodiles of MR-KR-GR do not suffer penalties to swimming as their armor thickens. They may wear decorative cloth items without penalty, though any bonuses but magical ones are not retained.
- **Weapon Proficiency**: Crocodiles of MR-KR-GR have natural weaponry by way of their crushing jaws and their sweeping tails. They deal 1d10 damage with their jaws or tail. They can wield no other traditional arms, though in the Rolling Death Kingdom they can easily find fitted tail weapons or replacement fangs for additional damage dealings.
- **Monsoon Moods**: The crocodiles of MR-KR-GR are bound to ancient motions which saw their domination of the Rolling Death Kingdom. On sunny days, a crocodile is more susceptible to sleep spells, acting as though they had one less HD for the purposes of the spell’s effectiveness. On rainy and overcast days, the crocodile suffers no boon or malus. On days of the monsoon, storms, or other downpours, the crocodile increases all its damage dice by one degree and strikes a critical hit on an 18-20, which deals a Wounding.
- **River Lurker**: If a crocodile is able to ambush its opponent it gains a +2 to hit and may immediately make a Wounding if they roll a critical hit. If hidden in water, a crocodile can Hide-in-Plain Sight at a rate of 4-in-6.
- **Wounding**: A crocodile’s jaws are vicious and terrible. When a crocodile scores a critical hit while using its jaws, choose from the following options or roll 1d6: 1-3) nothing special; 4) if the victim is of lesser size they must save vs Con or be Maimed; 5) if the victim is of lesser size they must save vs Con or be swallowed whole for 1d4 damage per turn until they can cut themselves out -- larger creatures use the previous result; 6) target tossed 1d10+9ft and take falling damage.

#### Chameleon-subrace
Requires: Str9-
- **Chameleon Scales**: You can cast a unique version of Disguise Self once per short rest per ProfBonus. Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for this. When you use this version of disguise self, you can seem up to 3ft taller or shorter than normal, allowing you to more easily blend in with small & medium creatures. You can't duplicate the appearance of a creature you've never seen, & you must adopt a form that has the same basic arrangement of limbs that you have.

#### Medusa-subrace
Requires: Int13+, Wis13+, Cha13+
- **Petrifying Visage**: When a creature that can see the medusa's face starts their turn within sight without averting their gaze, the creature must make a DC 8+(Medusa's ProfBonus) Constitution save. Creatures that fail are restrained. If the saving throw fails by 5 or more once, they become stunned; if twice, they become paralyzed; if thrice, they become petrified. The creature must repeat the saving throw at the end of their next turn, ending all Petrifying Visage effects on a success. Petrifying Visage is cured with a greater restoration spell or other restorative magic of greater power. A creature can avert their eyes to avoid the saving throw at the start of their turn; if so they count as blinded until the start of their next turn, when they can avert their eyes again. Creatures can break this averted gaze as a free action. If a medusa sees their own reflection in an area of bright light they are subjected to the full effect of their Petrifying Visage.
- **Curative Saliva**: A medusa's venomous saliva is a temporary repreive from petrification. Creatures that drink it suppress all petrifying effects until the drinker takes a long rest.
