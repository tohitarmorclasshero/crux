# Escalation Mage
Many know the tale of the shadow of Aureon, god of law and knowledge, coming into a life of its own as an evil deity. According to legend, the unholy divestiture was the price Aureon paid to master the arcane arts. Millennia later, mortals who walk the paths of the escalation mage still benefit from Aureon’s sacrifice. By giving themselves over to the Shadow and focusing on the dark side of magic, these arcane spellcasters learn how to “bargain” with their god to make their spells more effective -- for a price.
It is an ongoing dialogue. Such devotees must entreat the Shadow for aid before casting every spell they wish to enhance, and success is not guaranteed. As a general rule, the more control the caster has over magic, the greater the likelihood of maintaining that control. Yet even tried and true incantations can take unexpected tolls on occasion, as a boosted spell becomes too much to handle. This process of arcane enhancement through silent prayer is known as “escalation”, and while the rewards can potentially be great, few arcanists are quite so faithful as to risk life and limb merely for the possibility of greater efficacy. Those who take these risks are known as escalation mages, and if they survive their early years, they can grow into the most powerful mages to walk the face of Eberron.

BECOMING AN ESCALATION MAGE
Although this is an arcane spellcasting class, the most important characteristic of any who would enter is abiding faith. Only those who truly believe that they will become greater spellcasters by the grace of magic’s dark half stand a chance of making the hope a reality, and they must be prepared to pay whatever price the Shadow demands. The wizard’s path is potentially the shortest to becoming an escalation mage, but any arcane spellcaster can qualify with ease, including sorcerers and even warlocks. The Dark Six worshipers’ propensity for rhyme even produces a disproportionate number of bards who enter the class. In addition to the character’s normal casting ability score, Charisma (for certain class features) and Constitution (for the hit point loss exacted by the Shadow) are the key abilities for any escalation mage.

**Entry Requirements**
_Skills_: Concentration 4, Arcana 8
_Feats_: Any metamagic feat
_Special_: Cast Lv5, must worship the Shadow

_**Class Skills** (2+INT/Lv)_: Bluff, Concentration, Craft, Decipher Script, Hide, Intimidation, Arcana, Cosmology, Religion, Profession, Insight, Spellcraft.

_**The Shade Within (Ex)**_: When you 1st embark upon the path of the escalation mage, you draw strength from the Shadow to prepare for the dangerous road ahead. At Lv1 you permanently gain a number of HP=1+CHA (min 1). At each subsequent Lv, you gain +1 HP. For example, an escalation mage who reaches Lv5 would have received a total of (5+CHA, min 5) extra HP.

_**Escalation (Su)**_: By appealing to the arcane mastery of the Shadow, you put yourself at risk in exchange for the promise of power. Beginning at Lv2 you learn how to instantly work such appeals into your arcane spellcasting. These escalations do not actually change the spell’s level or casting time. The more escalations you master, the more powerful your spells potentially become, but the greater the risk to yourself. You can use escalation a number of times per day equal to your class level.
Using an escalation effect requires a swift action unless stated otherwise in the text below, and applies only to the next spell you cast as long as it is within 1 round. You can use only 1 escalation effect per spell.
You can use escalation effects in conjunction with other metamagic, but doing so involves additional risk, as you must use the spell’s new level (including the metamagic effect) to set the caster level check DC (see below).
Escalation effects can be applied to spell-like abilities just as if they were spells.
Failing the check also means that the spell is not cast, though you don’t lose the spell and can attempt to cast it again.
- _Shadow Focus_: Upon reaching Lv2 you unlock the 1st secret of the art of escalation. You can attempt to increase the effective level of a spell by +1 (as the Heighten Spell metamagic). The caster level check DC=10+2xSpellLv. If you fail the check, you immediately take 1 point of damage per SpellLv.
- _Shadow Power_: Beginning at Lv3 you learn to escalate the potency of your spells. You can attempt to increase all variable numeric effects of the spell by 1-half (as the Empower Spell metamagic). The caster level check DC=12+2xSpellLv. If you fail the check, you immediately take 2 damage per Spell Lv and gain +1 Exhaustion.
- _Shadow Growth_: Upon reaching Lv4 you learn to bargain with the Shadow to shape your magics. You can attempt to increase any numeric measurements of a burst, emanation, line, or spread spell’s area by 50% (as the Widen Spell metamagic). The caster level check DC=14+2xSpellLv. If you fail the check, you immediately take 3 damage per Spell Lv and gain the Shaken condition.
- _Shadow Haste_: By the time you reach Lv5 you can entreat the Shadow to catalyze your spellcasting. You can attempt to cast the spell with a casting time of 1 Action as a Bonus action (as the Quicken Spell metamagic). The caster check is DC=16+2xSpellLv. If you fail the check, you immediately take 5 per Spell Lv and become Slowed. 
- _Soul of Shadow (Ex)_: At the culmination of your studies, you master enough of the Shadow’s capricious nature to exert some small measure of control over your escalations. You can employ each of your 4 escalations (shadow focus, shadow power, shadow growth, and shadow haste) 1/day without a caster level check. These uses are in addition to those normally granted by your class level. One restriction exists: you may not apply any free escalation to the highest level of arcane spell you are capable of casting. For example, a Lv5 wizard/Lv6 escalation mage can cast Lv6 wizard spells, but can only apply her free escalation effects to spells of Lv5 or lower. Her normal escalation effects can be applied to any of her spells.

PLAYING AN ESCALATION MAGE
Given the nature of their beliefs and activities, the majority of escalation mages are evil-aligned. This tendency makes them somewhat ill-suited to be PCs, but this need not be the case. Whatever your moral outlook, you worship the Shadow genuinely, if not exclusively, and truly believe in the god’s superiority to its “creator,” Aureon.
You are often a solitary individual, walking a narrow road with only scholarship and faith for companions. The rigors you endure also ensure that escalation mages are never very prevalent. An exception could be a cult of mages devoted specifically to the power of the Shadow. Such cults are rare and extremely diverse, however, and most of you have little to no affiliation with the others, making discovery difficult.

**Combat**
As with other arcane casters, you devote yourself to magical advancement and therefore become a powerful spellcaster. Usually, you focus on schools of magic that enhance your association with the Shadow, using spells of a martial or damaging nature, as befits the god’s tastes. You are generally weak in physical combat, preferring instead to hang back and launch magical attacks. However, at the cost of some mental resilience, you are surprisingly tough: You gain extra hit points and greater physical fortitude.
You truly come into your own at 2nd level, when you acquire the ability to escalate the power of your spells. You can potentially increase the effectiveness of any spell you cast, though you must be careful not to risk such escalation too often, lest the Shadow ask for too much in return.
At high level, you can be one of the most terrifying spellcasters to face. While your spell selection is no greater or worse than any other spellcaster of equal level, you have the potential to make any spell much more effective, without sacrificing higher-level spell slots in the process. By 6th level, you can even call upon such abilities in times of need without risk of harm.

**Advancement**
Few arcane spellcasters make the conscious choice to incorporate faith into their magical techniques, but arcane followers of the Shadow know that it is the way to power. You are the result of focusing on this dialogue with the divine to the exclusion of other paths. Even so, your path does not involve forsaking any magical studies. The Shadow merely enables traditional arcane mastery through faith and occasional self-sacrifice; it doesn’t replace or alter it in any way.
As you advance in this class, your relationship to the Shadow strengthens, allowing you to uncover new escalations while growing more confident in your ability to call upon known ones. This process is a powerful religious experience. By the time you reach the culmination of the class, you feel as deep and potent a connection to your god as does even the most pious priest.

ESCALATION MAGES IN THE WORLD
Escalation mages, though rare, are dangerous because they are not restricted to a particular region or environment. Wherever the lure of arcane power is strong, the escalation mage arises. Some serve the Shadow (and themselves) from within the ranks of other organizations or even other faiths, where their true allegiances remain all but invisible in the course of day-to-day affairs. In other areas, such as in Droaam, escalation mages walk the streets as arcane nobility.

**Organization**
Escalation mages have no real organization. However, the class does contain arcane cabals, which concentrate local influence.
The arcane cabal has no predetermined structure. It is simply a gathering of like-minded mages who put their faith in the Shadow. In this regard, each cabal is more akin to a cult of the Dragon Below than anything else. In some areas, it is known as a “ring,” in others a “cell,” and in certain city-based cases, a “salon.” The only rule that applies across the board is that might makes right: The most advanced mage in the cabal determines policy.
Much of a given cabal’s activity depends on the circumstances surrounding its foundation. Some are very politically involved and operate as underground cells, subverting the local government or predominant faith in the Shadow’s name. In wilder areas, particularly where the goblinoid races are strong, a cabal might act as tribal council and even contain priests of the Shadow. In more civilized venues, arcane cabals are little more than social groups—“clubs” of spellcasters devoted to the Shadow and to exploring its mysteries. Whatever else it does, the arcane cabal always exists to increase the magical might of its members, and any individual mage who wants to get ahead had better have something to offer the group.
The arcane cabal is thus doubly merit-based. Not only is arcane mastery the gauge by which status is measured, but a member’s direct benefit to the cabal determines how much aid and magical learning she can expect to receive. Higher level does not always equate to higher involvement, however. Some of the most advanced spellcasters do the least to better their colleagues’ situations and thus are the least inclined to require or receive aid. By the same token, a lower-level mage who actively assists and betters his fellows is likely to receive a great deal in return, even from those who did not benefit directly.

ESCALATION MAGE LORE
Characters with Religion or Bardic Knowledge can research escalation mages to learn more about them. When a character makes a successful skill check or Bardic Knowledge check, read or paraphrase the following, including the information from lower DCs.
**DC10**: Some arcane spellcasters offer prayers to the Shadow in hope of earning favor.
**DC15**: The most devout arcanists receive an answer to their prayers, gaining an occasional surge of great power in their spellcasting, though often at a terrible price.
**DC20**: These surges of the Shadow’s power are known as “escalations,” and some mages spend their lives dedicated to discovering and mastering them.

Anyone who witnesses an escalation in use can attempt a DC25 Arcana check or a DC20 Religion check to discern that the caster is one of the Shadow’s favored arcane disciples.

ESCALATION MAGES IN THE GAME
Player characters need not realize that they have encountered an escalation mage until you feel the time is right. And even if the PCs know they are dealing with an arcanist who worships the Shadow, they cannot be sure he is actually an escalation mage until they see him use escalations in combat. Escalation mages also provide great narrative context, making equally interesting temporary allies against shared foes, or hidden masterminds behind long-term campaigns.
Like other arcane spellcasters, escalation mages make poor front-line fighters, and the DM should ensure that any encounter featuring an escalation mage provides proper distance from the PCs, at least initially. Use lower-level ground troops to act as blockers or fodder -- undead are always a good fi t with the Shadow.

Adaptation
Although the concept and methods of the escalation mage clearly link it to the Shadow, the class can easily be adapted to suit other faiths or even entirely different settings. The idea of “power at a price” is an archetypal one and need not necessarily require deity worship. The class could work just as well with an archfiend as its focus, for example.
