# Heritage-Drider

## Driders
Not spider-centaurs; think more spider/octopus crossbreeds
Requires: Dex15+
- **Long-Limbed**: When you make a melee attack on your turn, your reach is 5ft greater than normal.
- **Surprise Attack**: If you surprise a creature & hit it with an attack on your first turn in combat, the attack deals an extra +2d6 damage. You can use this trait only once per short rest.
- **Vampiric Bite**: Your fanged bite is a natural weapon, which counts as a simple melee weapon with which you are proficient. You add your Constitution modifier, instead of your Strength modifier, to the attack & damage rolls when you attack with this bite. It deals 1d4 piercing damage on a hit. While you are missing half or more of your hit points, you have advantage on attack rolls you make with this bite. When you attack with this bite & hit a creature that isnâ€™t a Construct or an Undead, you can regain hit points equal to the piercing damage dealt by the bite. You can empower yourself with this bite a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, & you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
