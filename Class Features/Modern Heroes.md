When the Fast hero would be reduced to zero HP or less by damage in combat (from ranged or melee attacks), the Fast hero can attempt to roll with the damage. A Fast hero spends an Inspiration to use this talent. Once the point is spent, the hero makes a DEX save (DC=dmg dealt). If they succeed, they take only half damage. The Fast hero must be able to react to the attack to execute a defensive roll if the hero is immobilized, they can't use this talent.
**Opportunist**: The Fast hero can spend an Inspiration to use this talent.

**Remain Conscious**: The Tough hero gains the ability to continue to perform actions when he or she would otherwise be considered unconscious and dying.

#### Researcher Talent Tree (Smart)
The Smart hero has a natural aptitude for study and fact-finding. These talents can be selected in any order.
**Savant**: Select 1 of the Skills listed below. The hero must already have ranks in the skill. The Smart hero adds their Lv when making checks with that skill. A Smart hero can take this talent multiple times; each time it applies to a different skill.

- Decipher
- Insight
- Investigate
- Medicine
- Nature

**Linguist**: With this talent, the Smart hero becomes a master linguist. Whenever the hero encounters a new language they don't know, the Smart hero can make an INT check to determine if they can understand it. The check is made with a bonus =Lv. For a written language, the bonus applies to an Investigate check instead. The DC for the check depends on the situation: DC15 if the language is in the same group as a language the hero knows; DC20 if the language is unrelated to any other languages the hero knows; & DC25 if the language is exotic or unique. The Smart hero can glean enough meaning from a conversation or document to ascertain the basic message, but this ability in no way simulates actually being able to converse or fluently read and write in a given language. A single check covers roughly 1H of spoken language or 1 page of written.
Prerequisite: Proficiency in at least 3 languages.

#### Strategist Talent Tree (Smart)
The Smart hero has the brainpower to see solutions in most situations. These talents can be selected in any order, but before the hero can select a talent from this tree they must have previously selected at least 1 talent from the Research Talent Tree.
**Exploit Weakness**: After 1R of combat, the Smart hero can designate 1 opponent and try to find ways to gain an advantage. The Smart hero uses an Action and makes a DC15 INT check with a bonus =Lv. If the check succeeds, until next Rest the Smart hero uses their INT bonus instead of either STR or DEX on Attacks as the hero finds ways to outthink their opponent and notices weaknesses in their opponent's fighting styles.
_Prerequisite_: 1 talent from the Research Talent Tree.
**Plan**: Prior to an encounter the Smart hero can develop a plan of action to handle the situation. Using this talent requires preparation; a Smart hero can't use this talent when Surprised or otherwise unprepared for a situation. Creating a plan requires 1T. After creating the plan the Smart hero makes an DC10 INT check with a bonus =Lv. Success grants 1 Inspiration to the Smart hero and their allies.

To play a trick on a target, the hero must use an Action and make a DC15 INT check +Smart Lv. If the check succeeds, the target can try to think quickly and ignore the trick. The target makes a Wisdom save (DC8 +Smart Lv +INT), or becomes Dazed for 1R. After the 1st trick -- whether successful or not -- that target becomes immune to such ploys until the Smart hero's next Short Rest.
_Prerequisite_: 1 talent from the Research Talent Tree.

#### Empathic Talent Tree (Insightful)
The Insightful hero's innate talents give them a great capacity for empathy.
**Empathy**: The Insightful hero has a knack for being sensitive to the feelings and thoughts of others without having those feelings and thoughts communicated in any objectively explicit manner.
