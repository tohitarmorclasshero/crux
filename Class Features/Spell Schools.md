## Wizard Schools

Arcane Traditions
The study of wizardry is ancient, stretching back to the earliest era of creation. 
It is firmly established in the Elder Scrolls universe, with various traditions dedicated to its complex study.
The most common arcane traditions in the universe revolve around the schools of magic. Mages through the ages have cataloged thousands of spells, grouping them into 8 categories called schools, as described in Chapter 7. In some places, these traditions are literally schools; a budding Mage might study at the School of Illusion while another studies across town at the School of Mysticism. In other institutions, the schools are more like academic departments, with rival faculties competing for students and funding.
Even Mages who train apprentices in the solitude of their own towers use the division of magic into schools as a learning device, since the spells of each school require mastery of different techniques. Of the six accepted schools of magic, Mages focus on Alteration, Destruction, Illusion, and Mysticism. Mages of Restoration exist, but they train in healer's traditions more often than not, and Conjuration is the purview of Conjurers.

#### School of Making

#### School of Alteration
You are a student of spells that modify energy and matter. To you, the world is not a fixed thing, but eminently mutable, and you delight in being an agent of change. You wield the raw stuff of creation and learn to alter both physical forms and mental qualities. Your magic gives you the tools to become a smith on realities forge.
Some Alteration Mages are tinkerers and pranksters, turning people's flesh into wood, or weighing them down with burden spells. Others seek to simplify their lives and protect others. Yet others seek to shape the world in their image.
You may now cast Alteration spells above 3rd level.

###### Alteration Mastery: Grand Transmuter
Starting at 14th level, if you do not have the Major Feat Altering Stone, you may create an Altering Stone as described under the Major Feat. You will not be able to recreate further stones unless you take the feat.
You can use your action to consume the reserve of Alteration magic stored within your Alteration Stone or two 5th-level spell slots and two 4th-level spell slots in a single burst. When you do so, choose one of the effects listed under Master Transmuter as described in the Player's Handbook page 119, noting that Restore Life does not use the Raise Dead spell, but instead the Reincarnate spell. Your Alteration Stone is destroyed or your spell slots cannot be recovered until you finish a long rest.

#### School of Entropy
You focus your study on magic that creates powerful elemental effects such as bitter cold, searing flame, rolling thunder, crackling lightning, and burning acid. Some Entropy Mages find employment in military forces as Battlemages, others use their spectacular power to protect the weak, while some seek their own gain as bandits, adventurer's or aspiring tyrants.
You may now cast Entropy spells above 3rd level.

###### Destruction Mastery: Master Entropist
At 14th level, you can increase the power of your simpler spells. When you cast an Entropy spell of 1st through 5th level that deals damage, you can deal max damage with that spell.

#### School of Illusion
You focus your studies on magic that dazzles the senses, befuddles the mind, and tricks even the wisest folk. Your magic is subtle, but the illusions crafted by your keen mind make the impossible seem real. Some illusionists are benign tricksters who use their spells to entertain. Others are more sinister masters of deception, using their illusions to frighten and fool others for their personal gain, and some alter the very fabric of their target's minds.
You may now cast Illusion spells above 3rd level.

###### School Mastery: Illusory Reality
At 14th level, you have learned the secret of weaving psychic magic into your illusions to give them a semi-reality. You gain the class feature Illusory Reality as described in the Player's Handbook on page 118.

#### School of Mysticism
You focus your study on the magics that interact with the very fibers of reality, embracing a temporary form of madness. As a Diviner, you strive to part the veils of space, time, and consciousness so that you can see and act clearly. You work to master spells of discernment, travel, control, and foresight.
You may now cast Mysticism spells above 3rd level.

###### School Mastery: Defy the Dragon
At 14th level, you have developed a keen understanding of the rules of reality 
itself, and have discovered how to simultaneously exist in 2 places at once. Once per long rest, as an action, you may split yourself into 2 beings for up to 1 hour. This other you will disappear if they take damage, and cannot cast spells or make attacks, however they can interact with the world, relaying messages or helping to solve puzzles, for example.
